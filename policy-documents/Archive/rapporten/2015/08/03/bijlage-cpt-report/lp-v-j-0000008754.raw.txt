EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist on 10 October 2010, when Curaçao and Sint Maarten 
acquired the status of countries within the Kingdom, alongside the Netherlands and Aruba. The 
three other islands, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands with the 
equivalent status of a municipality. Collectively, the six islands are now known as the Caribbean 
part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  
 
The CPT’s delegation visited Bonaire, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. It examined the treatment 
of inmates and the conditions of detention in the prison establishments located on each of the four 
islands visited. It also focussed on the situation of persons deprived of their liberty by the police. In 
addition, on Aruba and Curaçao, the delegation looked at the treatment of involuntary patients 
placed in psychiatric facilities and of irregular migrants in immigration detention centres. The 
situation of juveniles deprived of their liberty was also examined. 
 
The delegation received very good co-operation from the relevant authorities during the visit. 
Nevertheless, the principle of cooperation also requires that decisive action be taken to improve the 
situation in the light of the CPT’s key recommendations, and the findings of the 2014 visit suggest 
that while progress could be identified on a number of issues, continued efforts are needed to ensure 
full implementation of all its recommendations.  
 
Policing 
 
No allegations of ill-treatment by police officers of arrested persons were received in Bonaire. 
However, in Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten some allegations of ill-treatment of persons, 
including of juveniles, were received, which usually consisted of kicks and punches to the body 
after the person had been handcuffed and brought under control. The authorities should regularly 
remind police officers to use no more force than is strictly necessary and that ill-treatment will be 
punished accordingly. Further, the duration of remand detention on police premises, which may last 
up to 10 days, should be reduced to the shortest amount of time possible. As regards more 
specifically Curaçao, full authority for the care of police detainees placed in Block 1 of the Centre 
for Detention and Correction in Curaçao (SDKK) should be transferred to the prison authorities. 
 
In relation to safeguards against ill-treatment by police officers, most detained persons interviewed 
only met with their lawyer for the first time when appearing before a judge, which could be up to 
three days and 16 hours after the initial arrest. Steps should be taken to guarantee the right of access 
to a lawyer in practice, including during any police interview, as from the very outset of deprivation 
of liberty. Further, steps should be taken to guarantee that all detained persons are able to notify a 
third party of their deprivation of liberty and receive feedback from police officers when such 
notification has been carried out by the police.  
 
Material conditions were poor in many of the police stations visited as well as in Block 1 at SDKK. 
In Aruba, the CPT’s delegation had been informed that San Nicolas Police Station was not used for 
overnight detention which turned out to be incorrect. Persons were being detained for several days 
in this station, including a 15-year old boy who spent ten days in conditions that could be 
considered as amounting to inhuman and degrading treatment. The CPT recommends that the 
detention cells at San Nicolas Police Station be taken out of use until such time as they have been 
fully refurbished and the sewage problems properly resolved. More generally, juveniles should not 
be held overnight in police stations. Further, in Aruba and Curaçao, the current practice of keeping 
detained persons, deemed to be at risk of suicide, naked in their cells should be ended; instead, such 
persons should be the subject of a specific care protocol.  

- 9 - 
As regards discipline and segregation, procedural safeguards for prisoners suspected of having 
committed a disciplinary offence should be strengthened and solitary confinement as a disciplinary 
punishment should not exceed 14 days. The disciplinary unit of KIA was found to be unfit for 
holding human beings and, while acknowledging the steps taken by the Aruban authorities to 
improve the cleanliness and hygiene in this unit, the CPT considers that further action is still 
required before these cells are adequate for accommodating prisoners. The situation of prisoners 
segregated for their own protection, notably in Curaçao, should be improved and a specific policy 
for managing these persons should be drawn up. 
 
The health-care services at KIA and SDKK prisons suffered from financial insecurity, resulting in 
delays or no access to external specialist care and laboratory testing. Further, at SDKK the situation 
was more critical as health-care staff and pharmacy bills had not been paid for many months. The 
provision of health-care services in KIA, SDKK and Pointe Blanche Prisons should be reviewed: 
medical screening upon admission was generally inadequate, the recording of injuries poor and 
medical confidentiality not fully respected.  
 
The forensic psychiatric support unit (FOBA) at SDKK offered good material conditions and a 
positive atmosphere. By contrast, a similar unit at KIA (IBA) offered poor conditions and provided 
minimal psychological and psychiatric treatment. These units cannot be considered as proper 
psychiatric institutions appropriate for offenders who have been ordered to undergo psychiatric 
treatment. Indeed, in all four prisons, the delegation encountered prisoners who were in need of 
improved mental health care or even placement in a hospital. 
 
Foreign nationals held under aliens legislation 
 
Targeted visits were carried out to the immigration detention facilities of Centro Dakota in Aruba 
and of Illegalen Barakken in Curaçao. Material conditions could generally be considered as 
adequate. However, the regime at Illegalen Barakken was particularly restrictive and in both 
facilities there was a lack of purposeful activities offered to persons held longer than a few days. 
Further, staff at both facilities had not received any specific training on working with irregular 
migrants and safeguards, such as a medical screening upon arrival and receiving information in a 
language an immigration detainee understands, were lacking. Appropriate regulations for the 
detention of irregular migrants, including the introduction of an effective legal remedy entailing 
legal assistance, should be developed and adopted.  
 
Juveniles 
 
The situation for young persons at JICN was largely positive; staff were trained to work with 
juveniles and treated them in a correct and respectful manner, and several programmes were in 
place to provide meaningful activities for the young prisoners. Nevertheless, care should be taken 
not to place juveniles with young adults. By contrast, at KIA, the conditions of detention and 
activities in place for juveniles were not conducive to developing a supportive environment to assist 
their educational development and the enhancement of their social skills. Moreover, the situation of 
juveniles held on remand at Philipsburg Police Station in Sint Maarten was totally inappropriate and 
the CPT trusts that the new 20-place juvenile detention unit will provide suitable alternative 
arrangements.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
A. Dates of the visit and composition of the delegation 
 
 
1. In pursuance of Article 7 of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter referred to as “the Convention”), a 
delegation of the CPT carried out a visit to the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands 
from 12 to 22 May 2014. The visit was one which appeared to the Committee “to be required in the 
circumstances” (cf. Article 7, paragraph 1, of the Convention). 
 
 
2. The visit was carried out by the following members of the CPT:  
 
- Wolfgang HEINZ (Head of the delegation)  
 
- James McMANUS  
 
- Olivera VULIC  
 
- Hans WOLFF 
 
They were supported by Hugh CHETWYND (Head of Division) and Berber BIALA-HETTINGA 
of the CPT’s Secretariat and were assisted by: 
 
- Vivian LEBLANC (interpreter) 
 
- Manuel MADURO (interpreter) 
 
- Karel THIJS (interpreter). 
 
 
B. Context of the visit and constitutional structure 
 
 
3. During the previous CPT visit in 2007, the Kingdom of the Netherlands consisted of three 
countries: the Netherlands, Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles was 
formed by the islands Bonaire, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius and Saba. Between 2000 and 
2005, however, all the islands of the then Netherlands Antilles held referenda on the status of each 
island within the Kingdom and all the islands except Sint Eustatius voted for dissolution of the 
Netherlands Antilles. The Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist when the amended Charter for the 
Kingdom of the Netherlands entered into force, on 10 October 2010. 
 
In the new constitutional structure, in accordance with the outcome of the referenda, 
Curaçao and Sint Maarten have acquired the status of countries within the Kingdom, making them 
full, autonomous partners within the Kingdom. Aruba retained the separate country status it had 
already had since 1986.

D. Consultations held by the delegation and co-operation encountered  
 
 
6. In the course of the visit, the delegation held talks with Ivo Opstelten, Minister of Security 
and Justice of the Netherlands, Arthur Dowers, Minister of Justice of Aruba, Nelson Navarro, 
Minister of Justice of Curaçao and Dennis Richardson, Minister of Justice of Sint Maarten. The 
delegation further met Guus Schram, Attorney-General for Curaçao, St. Maarten, Bonaire, Sint 
Eustatius and Saba and Marc van Erve, Acting Attorney-General for Aruba. 
 
In addition, the delegation met the chiefs of police, directors of prisons and other institutions 
visited, as well as senior officials in the various ministries of justice and health. It also consulted 
with representatives of the Council on Law Enforcement and the different prison supervisory 
committees. A list of the national authorities and civil society members met by the delegation is set 
out in the Appendix to this report. 
 
  

- 15 - 
F. National Preventive Mechanism 
 
 
10. The Netherlands ratified the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against 
Torture (OPCAT) in September 2010. Since December 2011, four bodies are designated as National 
Preventive Mechanism, namely the Inspectorate of Security and Justice (also acting as coordinating 
body); the Health Care Inspectorate; the Inspectorate for Youth Care; and the Council for the 
Administration of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles.  
 
 However, at present, ratification only applies to the Kingdom in Europe, which means that 
the Caribbean part of the Kingdom is currently not bound by this Protocol and the Dutch NPM does 
not have a mandate to visit places of deprivation of liberty on these six islands. 
 
The CPT would like to be informed whether consideration is being given to extending 
the territorial application of OPCAT to the BES islands as well as to Aruba, Curaçao and Sint 
Maarten. 
 
 
 
  

- 17 - 
In brief, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
6
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
7
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to the 
8
prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
9
further extended by the prosecutor for an additional maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
10
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of their liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP BES. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by 
11
the investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
12
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
13
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, the JICN. 
 
 Arrested persons can spend a maximum of ten days in the police custody block before being 
released or transferred to another block. Juveniles and young adults are generally transferred to a 
dedicated block upon admission.  
 
 
14. The delegation did not receive any allegations of ill-treatment by police officers on Bonaire 
at the time of arrest or during the subsequent interview process and detention. Equally, there were 
no allegations of ill-treatment by prison staff of persons detained at the police custody block at 
JICN. Most persons interviewed stated that they had been treated well both by police and prison 
officers.  
 
 
2. Safeguards against ill-treatment 
 
 
15. The CPT attaches particular importance to three fundamental safeguards for persons 
deprived of their liberty by the police: the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or 
another person of their choice of their situation; the right of access to a lawyer; and the right of 
access to a doctor. These three rights represent fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of 
persons deprived of their liberty, which should apply from the very outset of the deprivation of 
liberty. In addition, it is important that all detained persons are informed of their rights in a 
language they understand.

The delegation was also informed that suspects could be detained by the police for a 
maximum period of eighteen days in police cell blocks on Sint Eustatius and Saba before being 
transferred to the JICN on Bonaire. This raises a number of questions. Given the fact that there is no 
permanent court presence on the islands, there may be difficulties in ensuring that a suspect is 
brought physically before a judge within the maximum of three days and 16 hours, as well as at the 
end of the first extension of custody, namely after ten days of ‘inverzekeringstelling’. The judicial 
control of the treatment of persons in custody on police premises, however, is an important 
safeguard against ill-treatment. Therefore, such persons should be physically brought before a judge 
at regular intervals, preferably of four days at most. Also, Article 94(2) CCP BES prescribes that 
‘bewaring’, which is the additional custody following the first ten days, should take place at a 
remand facility under the responsibility of the head of that facility, and therefore not at a police 
station. Finally, the CPT was informed that plans are in place to build a small prison on Sint 
Eustatius. This will bring additional complications regarding access to a lawyer and judicial control 
of treatment of persons in custody.  
 
The CPT wishes to receive the observations of the Dutch authorities on the above-
mentioned issues as well as confirmation that arrested persons are indeed brought before a 
judge as required by the CCP BES. The Committee recommends that the safeguards against 
ill-treatment be reinforced in the light of the above remarks. 
 
 
20. Detainees in Block H have access to the medical services of JICN. The delegation did not 
receive any complaints regarding access to a doctor by detainees during police custody.  
 
 
21. Custody registers were kept in an adequate manner. The delegation noted that the 
administration at Block H was satisfactory, as it was in the rest of the prison.  
 
 
3. Conditions of detention 
 
 
22. The police custody block at JICN (Block H) consisted of twelve cells, two of which were 
used as isolation cells for the prison population; access to natural light was adequate and ventilation 
sufficient. Each of the cells was equipped with a bed, a table, a chair and a semi-partitioned toilet; 
however, they measured a mere 6 m². The cell for suspected body-packers was equipped with 
CCTV and an adapted toilet. Detainees had access to the shower block twice a day and outdoor 
exercise was offered twice a day for 30 minutes.      
 
The CPT considers that a cell size of 6 m² could be considered acceptable for single 
occupancy for short periods, on condition that detained persons are able to spend a reasonable part of 
the day outside the cell.   
 
The CPT recommends that detained persons be offered additional time outside their cell, 
particularly when they are held in Block H for more than two days.

B. Dutch Caribbean Correctional Institution - JICN 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
24. JICN, Location Bonaire, has progressively been transformed since 2008 from a remand 
prison to an establishment accommodating persons in police custody and remand and sentenced 
prisoners. 
 
Following the CPT’s report on the 2007 visit and in preparation for the transfer of 
responsibility for the prison to the Dutch authorities, the Dutch agency responsible for custodial 
17
institutions (or “DJI” ) developed an action plan for the improvement of the prison. The official 
capacity was doubled in 2008 to 52, expanded further to 76 in 2010 and then again in 2012 with the 
addition of pre-fabricated container cells. At the time of the visit, the prison had an official capacity 
of 112 and was holding 77 persons, of whom 24 were in remand custody and two were women. 
 
However, the current premises remain a temporary solution, as a new facility is being built 
on a different location with an intended capacity of 140 places (remand, sentenced, juvenile and 
female prisoners). This new facility is planned to be operational in 2015.  
 
 
25. The CPT welcomes the efforts of Dutch authorities to improve conditions of detention. 
However, it notes that the current prison population rate is already high (equivalent to 
approximately 460 per 100,000) and the envisaged capacity of the new facility, if fully used, would 
lead to a rate of imprisonment for Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba ranking among the highest in the 
world.  
 
 For its part, the CPT is far from convinced that providing additional accommodation will 
18
offer a lasting solution to overcrowding. Expanding prison capacity carries the risk of prison 
populations rising in tandem with the increased capacity. The Committee considers that it would be 
far preferable for a strategy for the sustainable reduction of the prison population to be put in place, 
which ensures that imprisonment is in practice the measure of last resort at all stages of the criminal 
justice system, from pre-trial to the execution of sentences. In the light of experience in certain 
other jurisdictions, consideration might also be given to avoiding sending persons to prison for short 
periods. Instead, such sentences could be served in the community. 
 
The CPT recommends that the Dutch authorities adopt and implement a coherent 
strategy designed to combat high imprisonment rates, taking due account of the relevant 
Council of Europe recommendations in this area, such as Recommendation R (99) 22 
concerning prison population inflation; Rec (2000) 22 of 29 November 2000 on improving the 
implementation of the European rules on community sanctions and measures; Rec (2003) 22 
on conditional release (parole); Rec (2006) 13 on the use of remand in custody; and 
Recommendation CM/Rec (2010)1 on the Council of Europe Probation Rules. 
  
 The CPT wishes to be informed when the new facility becomes operational and to 
receive information on the numbers and categories of prisoners held.

  While JICN was not full at the time of the visit, it had often been full in the past. 

- 23 - 
 
31. Purposeful activities are of crucial importance for the well-being of any prisoner. As regards 
more specifically sentenced prisoners, such activities are essential to render meaningful a term of 
imprisonment, help their rehabilitation and prepare them for life in the community.  
 
The delegation heard several complaints from prisoners about limited possibilities for work 
and education. At the time of the visit, work was available for approximately 50% of the prisoners, 
but most of these jobs were of a very simple nature and provided no further qualifications to assist 
19
reintegration following prison release.  
 
Opportunities for (professional) education were scarce. It was clear that efforts had been 
made to develop the curriculum over the years. Several courses were offered on subjects such as 
welding, music, drawing, aggression management training, and hair, skin and nail care. However, 
the range of activities, the number of places available and the frequency of the courses remained 
20
limited. Currently, there is no basic education for adults, although plans are in place.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the Dutch authorities pursue their efforts to offer 
purposeful activities to all prisoners. 
 
 
c. juveniles 
 
 
32. One of the cardinal principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
21 22
the Child and in the European Rules for juvenile offenders is that juveniles should only be 
deprived of their liberty as a last resort and for the shortest possible period of time and that in all 
23
action concerning them, their best interests shall be a primary consideration. The CPT’s basic 
position is that those juveniles who do have to be deprived of their liberty should be held in 
facilities specially designed for persons of this age, offering regimes tailored to their needs and 
staffed by persons trained in dealing with young persons.   
 
While the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have all changed their Criminal 
Codes to include placement in a juvenile institution (plaatsing in een inrichting voor jeugdigen/PIJ) 
as a measure for juveniles, this measure does not yet exist in law on Bonaire. Juveniles sentenced to 
incarceration are held at the special youth wing (Block G) of JICN, for prisoners up to the age of 24 
(young adults or JoVo). At the time of the visit, JoVo had a capacity of 18 and was holding seven 
prisoners under the age of 24.  
                                                 
19
  There are 12 places in the prison workshop where prisoners are trained in welding, painting and carpentry. An 
additional 10 positions are available in a project with the foundation Krusada. This cooperation was in the 
process of being expanded at the time of the visit. Other work includes cleaning, ice and water delivery and 
simple repairs.  
20
  In the second half of 2013, three women participated in two separate courses on nail styling and hair and skin 
care. Eight prisoners completed a music course; 11 prisoners participated in arts class; and 14 prisoners learnt 
how to build kites.

  See General Comment No. 14 (2013) on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a 
primary consideration (Article 3, paragraph 1) by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. See also the 1985 
United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“Beijing Rules”), the 
1990 United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (“Havana Rules”) and the 
1990 United Nations Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (“Riyadh Guidelines”). 

- 25 - 
34. The CPT acknowledges the difficulty in making adequate arrangements for the detention of 
a small number of juveniles as is the case in Bonaire. Nevertheless, the CPT considers that it is far 
preferable for juveniles to be held in specially designed detention centres, and that they should not 
be kept together with adults. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Dutch authorities take the necessary steps to ensure 
juveniles are not held together with adults and that every effort be made to accommodate 
them in specific juvenile facilities. As long as juveniles are held in JoVo, they should not have 
to share a cell with young adults. Further, the Dutch authorities should take the necessary 
legislative measures to introduce the requirement for juveniles on Bonaire to be placed in 
special juvenile institutions.

35. The section for women prisoners within JICN was in the old building and consisted of a 
12 m² cell with two sets of bunk beds, cupboards, a toilet, a sink and a shower, and a well-equipped 
recreation room (table, chairs, sofa, kitchen with several appliances, washing machine and dryer). 
The cell and recreation room were freshly painted and clean and, according to the two female 
prisoners, new furniture and kitchen equipment had arrived a few days prior to the CPT’s visit. In 
spite of these measures, the cell remained dark and poorly ventilated. 
 
In principle, the cell is too small to hold more than three persons, given the CPT standard of 
a minimum of 4 m² per person of living space in multi-occupancy cells. However, the CPT noted 
that the women were generally able to spend a large part of the day outside the cell. The Director 
explained that they were aware that the cell space was insufficient, but that under the circumstances it 
was their best solution. Improved accommodation should be available in the new facility. 
 
 
36. Activities offered to female prisoners included classes for handicrafts, nail styling, skin care 
and art. Courses took place a few times a year, but often female inmates had nothing to do and 
remained in either in their cell or in the recreation room the whole day, apart from the outdoor 
exercise and gym. The women were offered cleaning jobs for a few hours a day.  
 
Women deprived of their liberty should enjoy access to meaningful activities (work, 
training, education, sport, etc.). The female prisoners at JICN should not only be offered activities 
which have been deemed "appropriate" for them (such as handicrafts and hair styling), whilst male 
prisoners are offered training of a more vocational nature. In the view of the CPT, such a 
discriminatory approach can only serve to reinforce outmoded stereotypes of the social role of 
women. 
 
 The CPT recommends that women be offered additional schooling and relevant work 
opportunities in order to prepare them for their release. 
 
 
  

- 27 - 
40. The CPT has consistently stressed that prison health-care services can make a significant 
contribution to the prevention of ill-treatment of detained persons through, inter alia, the systematic 
recording of injuries, whether vis-à-vis new arrivals or following a violent episode in prison. At 
JICN, no guidelines or procedures exist for the systematic identification of ill-treatment. 
 
The CPT recommends that measures be taken to ensure that the record drawn up 
after the medical examination of a prisoner – whether newly arrived or following a violent 
incident in prison – contains:  
 
(i) an account of statements made by the person which are relevant to the medical 
examination (including his/her description of his/her state of health and any allegations 
of ill-treatment);  
(ii) a full account of objective medical findings based on a thorough examination;  
(iii) the doctor’s observations in the light of i) and ii) indicating the consistency 
between any allegations made and the objective medical findings.  
 
Recording of the medical examination in cases of traumatic injuries should be made on 
a special form provided for this purpose, with "body charts" for marking traumatic injuries 
that will be kept in the medical file of the prisoner. If any photographs are made, they should 
be filed in the medical record of the inmate concerned. In addition, documents should be 
compiled systematically in a special trauma register where all types of injuries should be 
recorded. 
 
The results of every examination, including the above-mentioned statements and the 
doctor’s opinions/observations, should be made available to the prisoner and, with the consent 
of the prisoner, to his or her lawyer. Further, the existing procedures be reviewed in order to 
ensure that whenever injuries are recorded which are consistent with allegations of 
ill-treatment made by a prisoner (or which, even in the absence of allegations, are indicative 
of ill-treatment), the report is immediately brought to the attention of the relevant prosecutor 
regardless of the wishes of the person concerned. 
 
 
41. As regards medical confidentiality, the CPT’s delegation found that it was partially 
respected. It appeared that medical examinations generally took place out of the hearing and sight of 
custodial staff and that medical documentation was only accessible to health-care staff. However, 
prisoners requesting medical care had to submit a request form to a prison officer who passed it on 
to the medical service. Prisoners were obliged to indicate a reason for requesting medical care. 
However, no envelopes were provided, which meant that the prisoner’s medical confidentiality was 
not guaranteed.  
 
 The CPT recommends that appropriate steps be taken to ensure that prisoners are 
able to have access to the prison’s health-care service on a confidential basis, not exposing 
medical information to non-medical staff.  
 
 
  

- 29 - 
44. Prisoners have a right to make phone calls at least once a week for ten minutes, which seems 
29
unduly restrictive. 
 
The CPT recommends that prisoners be granted regular and frequent access to the telephone. 
 
 
c. discipline 
 
 
45. The disciplinary procedures are clearly explained in the JICN House Rules, listing the 
sanctions of solitary confinement (maximum two weeks), restrictions on receiving visitors 
(maximum four weeks), a warning, restrictions on leave days and a fine. Review of the disciplinary 
measures showed that warnings are rarely used, while the most common disciplinary measure is 
solitary confinement in one’s own cell or in the disciplinary cell. Application of this measure did 
not appear to be excessive.  
 
JICN has four cells that can be used for solitary confinement, two in the old building and 
two in the police custody block. The cells provide acceptable conditions of detention and two 
periods of half an hour of outdoor exercise are offered each day. Medical staff visit persons in these 
cells on a daily basis. 
 
The CPT recommends that steps be taken to ensure that disciplinary punishment of 
30
prisoners does not include a total prohibition of family contacts and that any restrictions on 
family contacts as a form of punishment should be used only where the offence relates to such 
contacts. 
 
 
d. complaints and inspection procedures 
 
 
46. Prisoners can complain to the Prison Supervisory Committee, which consists of seven 
members. Each month, two members are appointed ‘commissioner of the month’, and are tasked 
with regular inspection visits to the facility and handling incoming complaints. Review of the total 
cases in 2013 showed that around 12% (13 out of 106) of the complaints were considered justified.  
  
 The procedure was generally clear and decisions were taken within a reasonable time-frame.   
 
 
47. The Law Enforcement Council (Raad voor de Rechtshandhaving) is an inter-country body 
of Curaçao, St. Maarten and the Netherlands. The Council is charged with the general inspection of 
the effectiveness and quality of several agencies and institutions of the judicial systems of Curacao, 
Sint Maarten and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba. The Council also monitors the effectiveness and 
quality of judicial cooperation between Curacao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands, in so far as the 
BES-Islands are concerned. It has a mandate to perform inspections but given the wide range of 
responsibilities and limited resources it does not perform regular visits to all places where persons 
may be deprived of their liberty. An inspection of JICN was carried out in August 2013, and the 
report was presented to the Ministry of Security and Justice in February 2014.

ARUBA 
 
 
A. Police 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
48. At the time of the 2014 visit, the 1996 Code of Criminal Procedure of Aruba (CCP) 
remained in force. The rules for detaining persons under this Code were described in detail in the 
31
report on the CPT’s visit in 2007.  
 
In brief, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
32
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
33
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to 
34
the prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
35
further extended by the prosecutor for an additional maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
36
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of his/her liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by the 
37
investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
38
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
39
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, at the Correctional Institute of Aruba (KIA). 
 
The CPT considers that a person should be kept in police custody for the shortest amount of 
time possible, preferably less than 24 hours. To this end, it recommends that the Aruban 
authorities amend the draft CCP accordingly.

  See CPT/Inf (2008) 2, Part 2, paragraphs 8 and 9.

Therefore this initial period may in fact last up to 16 hours.

- 33 - 
The right of notification may be restricted only if it is in the interests of the investigation and 
only for a short time. Any decision to restrict the right to notification must be taken by an assistant 
public prosecutor (i.e. a senior police officer) or the duty public prosecutor in consultation with the 
person leading the investigation, and the reasons must be noted in the electronic custody record. 
However, Article 90 of the CCP does not provide for any time limit for the restriction on the right 
of notification.  
 
The CPT recommends that the restriction of this right should be time-limited. 
 
 
53. In contrast to the findings at the time of the 2007 visit, most persons interviewed in the 
course of the 2014 visit either at a police station or in KIA stated that they had been able to inform a 
third person of their detention. This is a positive development. Nevertheless, a number of persons, 
notably foreign nationals, alleged that they had not been able to inform a third person of their 
detention.  
 
The CPT recommends that every effort be made to ensure that all detained persons 
are able to inform a third person of their situation as from the outset of their deprivation of 
liberty. 
 
 
c. access to a lawyer 
 
 
54. As the CPT has stated in the past, its objective of guaranteeing an effective right of access to 
a lawyer during police custody is not primarily linked to issues of due process or the right to a fair 
trial; it is aimed at preventing ill-treatment. In the CPT’s experience, it is during the period 
immediately following the deprivation of liberty that the risk of intimidation and ill-treatment is at 
its greatest. 
 
It follows that to be effective as a safeguard against ill-treatment, access to a lawyer must be 
guaranteed as from the very outset of deprivation of liberty. The right of access to a lawyer must 
include the right to talk to him/her in private; the detained person should also, in principle, be 
entitled to have the lawyer present during any interview with law enforcement officials.  
 
 
55. The Aruban CCP provides that every suspect who is brought to a place for questioning 
must, immediately thereafter, and in any case before any questioning begins, be informed of his 
right to be assisted by a lawyer and, if he cannot afford a lawyer, of his right, if he is placed in 
41
custody (inverzekeringstelling), to have one provided to him free of charge. 
  
                                                 
41
  See Article 82(1c) CCP. 

- 35 - 
 In the course of the 2014 visit, the CPT’s delegation noted the situation regarding access to a 
doctor has improved since the 2007 visit. A team of two police general practitioners, a forensic 
doctor and a nurse visited the police stations on a rota basis and, outside of working hours, were on 
permanent call. However, at San Nicolas Police Station it appeared that there had been no visits by 
a doctor for many months. Some detained persons met by the delegation complained that they had 
not been able to see a doctor while being held at this police station.  
 
 The CPT recommends that police officers be reminded that every request to see a 
doctor should be promptly dealt with in accordance with the Police Order on Detainees. 
Further, the police medical team should visit all police stations in which persons may be 
detained on a regular basis.  
 
 
e. information on rights and custody records 
 
 
58. A standard notification form, available in Dutch, Papiamento, English, and Spanish, was in 
use at the police establishments visited. The form had been updated since the 2007 visit and now 
included the right of a detained person to have a third person informed of his/her detention and the 
right of access to a doctor, in addition to the right to remain silent, the right to legal counsel and the 
right to have a lawyer assigned free of charge in the event of custody (inverzekeringstelling). The 
form requires the signature of the arresting officer and the arrested person. In the event that the 
arrested person refuses to sign, the refusal is also noted on the form. 
  
It appeared that the form was being systematically used and detained persons stated that they 
had been informed of their rights. 
 
 
59. In the police stations visited, the CPT’s delegation noted that the electronic custody records 
introduced in 2009 were both comprehensive and well kept, with the relevant information inserted. 
 
 
f. investigations into complaints of police ill-treatment 
 
 
60. The CPT considers that the diligent examination by the competent authorities of all 
complaints of ill-treatment by police officers brought before them and, where evidence of 
wrongdoing emerges, the imposition of appropriate disciplinary and/or criminal penalties, will have 
a very strong deterrent effect. For this reason, the persons responsible for overseeing and carrying 
out investigations into possible ill-treatment by law enforcement officials should be independent of 
those implicated in the events. Further, such investigations should offer guarantees of effectiveness, 
promptness, expeditiousness and transparency.  
 
As was the case in 2007, two bodies were competent to carry out investigations into 
misbehaviour by members of the Police Corps of Aruba (KPA): the Landsrecherche and the Bureau 
Interne Zaken en Onderzoeken (the KPA Internal Affairs and Investigations Bureau or ‛BIZO’). 
Both could carry out investigations into criminal offences, and the BIZO could also conduct 
disciplinary investigations. 
  

- 37 - 
 
 The detention facility at Santa Cruz Police Station, built in 2005, consisted of two corridors 
each with six cells; it had been freshly painted and was in a good state of repair. Each cell contained 
a concrete plinth and measured 7 m², including the partitioned toilet and shower (the water was 
switched on for 30 minutes twice a day). However, access to natural light was very limited and 
ventilation was extremely poor; at the time of the visit (7 p.m.), the temperature in the cells was 
31°Celsius. Further, the mattresses in the two occupied cells were worn and thin.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities take the necessary steps to improve 
the conditions of detention at Noord and Santa Cruz Police Stations, notably as regards access 
to natural light and ventilation; mattresses should be cleaned and sheets systematically 
provided. Further, all detained persons held for 24 hours or more should be offered access to 
outdoor exercise every day.  
 
 
64. At the outset of the visit, the CPT had been informed that the detention facility at San 
Nicolas Police Station was only being used to hold persons for a few hours. When the CPT’s 
delegation visited the facility the police officer on duty stated that detained persons were never held 
for more than one night in the station. This was plainly incorrect as the delegation met a number of 
46
persons who had been held in the detention facility at San Nicolas for extensive periods. The 
conditions in the seven-bed cell for women (measuring some 28 m²) and the 12 single-occupancy 
cells (each measuring 7 m²) were not acceptable; they had limited access to natural light, inadequate 
ventilation and artificial lighting and were in a poor state of repair. Two of the single-occupancy 
cells were used for cases of alcohol/drug withdrawal and possessed solid doors which meant that 
the air was even more stagnant and that access to natural light was non-existent. Above all, there 
was a rank, fetid smell emanating from the cells as the toilets did not flush properly. Detained 
persons who spent several days in these cells stated that when the toilets were flushed from outside 
the cell, the water would instead rise up over the toilet bowl and flood the floor with faeces and 
urine. Moreover, detained persons were frequently not provided with any outdoor exercise. 
 
 These conditions are clearly not suitable for holding detained persons. And yet, the CPT’s 
delegation met a 15 year-old boy who had been detained from 26 April to 6 May 2014 in this police 
station. For the first four days of his detention, he was not provided with a mattress, blanket or any 
47
hygiene products; nor was he offered any access to outdoor exercise. He was effectively kept in 
solitary confinement for ten days with no support. Such treatment could be considered as inhuman 
and degrading.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities take out of service the detention 
cells at San Nicolas Police Station until such time as they have been fully refurbished and the 
sewage problems resolved properly. Under no circumstances should a detained person be held 
overnight at this police station.  
 
Further, whenever it is considered necessary to deprive a juvenile of his/her liberty, he 
or she must be held in an appropriate place of detention commensurate with their needs and 
provided with care and support by properly trained child specialists. Juveniles should not be 
held in police stations overnight. 
 
 
                                                 
46
  For example, SR was held from 1 to 9 May and WL from 2 to 9 May 2014. 
47
  They were provided by his mother after four days. 

- 39 - 
B. Centro Dakota Immigration Detention Facility 
 
 
67. In the course of the 2014 visit, the delegation carried out a targeted visit to the Centro Dakota 
immigration detention facility. Foreign nationals held under aliens legislation have been detained at 
this facility since February 2013. Immigration detention on Aruba falls under the responsibility of 
50
the Aruban Police Force and is run by its Department for Supervision of Foreigners. At the time 
of the visit, four foreign nationals were being held at the facility; three men and one woman.  
 
 The majority of persons who have been ordered to leave or who are awaiting a decision on 
their appeal to an expulsion order are placed under an obligation to report to the police at regular 
intervals. Detention, however, still occurs frequently. In the first four months of 2014, a total of 78 
persons had been detained at Centro Dakota; 55 men and 23 women. The great majority of persons 
spent one to three days, while the maximum varied between 15 and 18 days. One person, however, 
had been detained for 57 days. 
 
 
68. At the time of the visit, immigration detention was regulated in the National Ordinance on 
Admission, Expulsion and Departure of 1993. According to Article 19(1) of this Ordinance, foreign 
nationals may be removed from Aruba if they entered the country illegally or overstayed the 
duration of their visa or permit. Article 19(2) provides that such a person may be detained if the 
Minister of Justice considers him or her to be a danger to public order and safety or good morals, or 
if there is a well-founded fear the person will attempt to evade expulsion. Article 19(3) stipulates 
that such a decision must be reasoned and provided in writing to the person concerned.  
 
 However, there were no specific regulations governing the detention of irregular migrants. 
While a right to appeal expulsion and detention orders is not provided in law, a right to appeal such 
a decision within six weeks is incorporated into the written orders. Immigrants who are being 
detained are free to consult a lawyer, but there are no legal aid provisions guaranteeing a right to a 
lawyer if one cannot be afforded.  
 
 The CPT’s delegation was informed that amendments to the National Ordinance were being 
drawn up which would introduce a 90-day maximum period of detention and included judicial 
review of detention orders within 72 hours. A right to legal aid and a right to appeal appear not to 
be envisioned in these amendments. 
 
 The delegation was also provided with a draft national decree regulating the regime of 
immigration detention, as well as with draft house rules based on the proposed decree. The 
delegation observed that the facility generally functioned in line with these documents, although 
they had not yet been formally adopted.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities move forward urgently with 
developing and adopting appropriate regulations for the detention of irregular migrants. 
Such regulations should include the right to legal assistance, provided free of charge for 
persons without sufficient means, and the right of appeal. 
 
 
                                                 
50
  This function was placed under the Aruban Police Force on 1 March 2012, changing the name from Guarda 
Nos Costa (border guards) into Afdeling Vreemdelingentoezicht. 

- 41 - 
73. The persons interviewed indicated that they had not undergone any medical screening upon 
admission. When a detainee is in need of medical care, he or she is first visited by the police nurse. 
If necessary a doctor can be called in, or the detainee is transferred to the hospital.  
 
 The CPT recommends that systematic medical screening of all immigration detainees, 
including for transmissible diseases, be introduced. Such screening should be carried out in a 
way that respects medical confidentiality. 
 
 
74. The arrangements for allowing foreign nationals contact with the outside world were generally 
adequate. They were allowed to receive visitors on a daily basis and were allowed to make and 
receive phone calls throughout the day. However, the draft House Rules provided that the maximum 
duration of visits will be 15 minutes; the CPT does not see any justification for such a time-limit 
and would propose that visits be one hour or longer in duration.  
 
 The CPT recommends that this provision in the draft House Rules be amended 
accordingly.  
 
 
75. As for information in a language detainees understand, the delegation noted that most staff 
members could communicate in Spanish (the language of the majority of immigration detainees in 
Aruba). However, communication problems can arise when other languages are needed. The 
delegation found that the draft House Rules had been translated into English and Spanish, but legal 
documents pertaining to individual detainees, such as their detention and deportation orders, are 
only available in Dutch. Staff made an effort to orally translate and explain these documents, but 
persons interviewed by the delegation indicated that they had refused to sign them, as they were not 
able to read them themselves.  
 
The CPT recommends that all immigration detainees be expressly informed of their 
rights and the procedures applicable to them in a language they can understand. All 
immigration detainees should be systematically provided with a document setting out this 
information; the document should be available in the languages most commonly spoken by 
those concerned and, if necessary, the services of an interpreter should be made available. 
Further, all official documents that immigration detainees are required to sign should be 
provided in a language they can understand. 
 
  

- 43 - 
 Addressing the phenomenon of inter-prisoner violence and intimidation requires that prison 
staff be alert to signs of trouble and both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary. 
The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of dynamic 
security and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff 
possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. It is also obvious that an effective 
strategy to tackle inter-prisoner intimidation/violence should seek to ensure that prison staff are 
placed in a position to exercise their authority in an appropriate manner. Consequently, the level of 
staffing must be sufficient (including at night-time) to enable prison officers to supervise adequately 
the activities of prisoners and support each other effectively in the exercise of their tasks. Both 
initial and ongoing training programmes for staff of all grades must address the issue of managing 
inter-prisoner violence. 
 
 In addition, a key component in the management of inter-prisoner relations is the careful 
assessment, classification and cell allocation of individual prisoners within the prison population.  
 
 The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the prison management of KIA develop a 
strategy to address the challenge of inter-prisoner violence, taking into account the above 
remarks. 
 
 
3. Conditions of detention 
 
 
a. material conditions 
 
 
79. At the time of the 2014 visit, the material conditions in much of the prison were in an 
advanced state of dilapidation. This was particularly the case in the HvB and Straf sections, where 
lumps of concrete and plaster were falling off the ceilings and the walls were being eroded by the 
wind, sand and salt. The state of decay was evident in all the cells visited and in many parts of the 
buildings the iron support rods were exposed. A piece of plaster had recently fallen on an inmate 
walking up the steps to the central gallery of the sentenced section, highlighting the dangerous 
nature of the situation. The delegation also noted flooding in many cells, either with leaking toilets 
or water running down the walls of the cells, which represents a safety, and even a health, hazard 
(inmates and staff slipping on the floors and mosquitoes breeding).  
 
2 
The cells in the HvB and Straf sections measured approximately 9.5 m and were equipped 
with a triple bunk bed plus mattress and blankets, chairs, table and cupboard. The sanitary annexes 
contained a combined WC/shower unit and a washbasin, and were partially partitioned from the rest 
of the cell. Access to natural light was good. However, the artificial lighting in many cells did not 
work which meant that from 6 p.m. until dawn it was dark. Further, many cells were very dusty as 
there was no means of preventing sand being blown into the cells.  
 
As the CPT has stated in the past, the size of the cells were entirely satisfactory for 
accommodating one person and could, on an exceptional basis, be considered acceptable for two 
(subject to the qualification that the sanitary annexe should be fully partitioned). However, they 
provided a very confined living space for three prisoners which was the situation found in many 
cells. 
  

- 45 - 
82. As regards the regime, the juveniles were offered one and a half hours of outdoor exercise 
every day and one and a half hours outside the cell in the hall area in front of the cells where they 
could use the fitness equipment. Complaints were heard from many of the young persons about the 
lack of activities on offer, notably the lack of education and vocational activities. Although the 
regime was complicated by the fact that there were three distinct groups of young persons in the 
unit who had to be kept separated due to outside rivalries, there were nevertheless far too few 
opportunities for young inmates to engage in purposeful activities. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities ensure that all juveniles held at 
KIA (whether on remand or sentenced) are provided with a full programme of vocational, 
educational, sports and recreational activities. 
 
 
83. One of the cardinal principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
53 54
the Child and in the European Rules for juvenile offenders is that juveniles should only be 
deprived of their liberty as a last resort and for the shortest possible period of time and that in all 
55
action concerning them, their best interests shall be a primary consideration.  
 
 At the time of the visit, the CPT’s delegation met a 15-year-old boy in the unit. The boy was 
kept apart from the other young prisoners by being placed in a separate cell and conducting his 
outdoor exercise alone. Nevertheless, he associated with the older youths on the wing and was not 
offered any specific activities. 
 
 In the CPT’s view, KIA was not a suitable place to accommodate a 15-year-old-boy 
and consideration should be given to providing a more child-centred environment for 
juveniles who must be deprived of their liberty. To this end, the CPT recommends that the 
authorities of Aruba develop a strategy for addressing the specific needs of juveniles deprived 
of their liberty. Moreover, the new Criminal Code provides for sentenced juveniles to be 
placed in a youth institution (Plaatsing in een inrichting voor jeugdigen). As long as juveniles 
are kept in KIA, additional efforts must be made to provide them with a full range of 
purposeful activities and socio-educative support. 
 
 
d. women prisoners 
 
 
84. The layout of the female unit was the same as that of the juvenile unit and was 
accommodating 10 women at the time of the visit. All the cells were clean, freshly painted and 
suitably equipped. However, the sanitary annexes were not fully partitioned and the toilets in 
several of the cells did not flush. Further, there were no call-bells and prisoners claimed that staff 
sometimes left the unit unattended. These deficiencies should be remedied.

It is essential that the excessive amount of overtime worked by some staff is reduced and 
that the rates of absenteeism among staff are tackled. This will require inter alia recruiting more 
staff and addressing staff management issues, such as ensuring that the promotion system is more 
meritocratic. The delegation met some very committed staff of different ranks who would like to 
see the prison evolve, and putting in place a staff development programme would contribute to the 
professionalisation of staff and assist towards creating the possibility of a rehabilitative regime in 
prison.  
 
Professionalisation of staff should see the role of a prison officer evolving from that of 
essentially a “turn-key” with no responsibility other than that of static security. Instead, prison 
officers should be encouraged to extend their role into interacting positively with inmates, taking 
part in rehabilitation programmes and being an integral element in a multi-disciplinary approach 
towards prisoners’ welfare. This would not only provide a far more challenging and interesting job 
for the prison officers but it would also address the rehabilitation aspect of prison which has to date 
been moribund. Of course, this would necessitate introducing far more training for those prison 
officers capable and willing to take up this additional role. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities take the necessary measures to 
increase the number of prison officers employed as well as to develop the capacity and role of 
prison officers, in the light of the above remarks. In parallel, the amounts of overtime should 
be reduced and the levels of, and reasons for, absenteeism tackled. 
 
 
87. More generally, it is important that prison officers be provided with regular in-service 
training courses to improve their skills and knowledge, and also refresher courses. For example, 
some officers told the delegation that they had not had refresher firearms training for seven years; if 
true, these officers should not be permitted to carry firearms, for example when carrying out escort 
duties.  
 
The CPT recommends that all prison officers be offered in-service training and that 
regular compulsory refresher courses be organised for core requirements of a prison officer’s 
job. 
 
 
88. In December 2013, prison officers staged a walk-out without providing any prior notice 
following months of disgruntlement over prison staff management. Taking advantage of the lack of 
prison officers present, some inmates of the HvB section rioted while others had to escape from 
their smoke-filled cells; order was only restored after the police intervened.  
 
Although strikes are not common, it is essential that every step be taken to ensure that 
prisoners’ rights are upheld and that their physical and psychological integrity is guaranteed 
whenever there is a strike by prison staff. In particular, prisoners should be offered at least one hour 
of outdoor exercise, access to medical care, regular meals and access to a shower as well as 
continued contacts with the outside world (especially visits, including by a lawyer). To this end, a 
binding agreement should be drawn up to ensure that there are sufficient staffing levels in the prison 
during a strike action to assure such a minimum service. 
 
The Committee recommends that the Aruban authorities establish a protocol for a 
guaranteed minimum service for inmates, applicable whenever there is a strike by prison 
staff, taking into account the above remarks.  

- 49 - 
 Further, the CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities take the necessary steps to 
ensure that KIA possesses the appropriate financial resources to pay for specialist medical 
care that prisoners require and for laboratory testing. In this connection, consideration might 
be given to developing a closer partnership with the Ministry of Health, with a view to 
improving quality control and access to health care. 
 
 
91. Access to health care within the prison was also problematic due to the current “requests” 
procedures in place in the prison. It appeared that prisoners had to place all requests into a box and 
certain prison officers were responsible for making a triage of the various requests and deciding on 
which ones were designated as “health” requests. The health requests were subsequently handed 
over to the medical service, sometimes weeks after the original request had been filed.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the prison authorities review the current requests 
procedures to ensure that all requests to see a doctor or nurse are directly transmitted to the 
health-care service without interference by prison staff. 
 
Further, the CPT has reservations about the utility of the prison doctor spending 
considerable amounts of time drawing up dietary plans for every prisoner. It would be preferable if 
his time was devoted to clinical care and the organisation of the medical service and, apart from 
drawing up a general dietary plan, should only exceptionally make a dietary recommendation for 
those inmates requiring a special dietary menu due to medical needs (such as diabetes).  
 
The CPT recommends that the involvement of the prison doctor in drawing up dietary 
plans for prisoners be reviewed, in the light of the above remarks. 
 
 
92. The premises of the health-care unit were insufficient to meet its needs. The consultation 
rooms were small and poorly ventilated; the inability to open the windows and aerate the rooms 
after consultations represents a clear health risk. Further, water was leaking through the ceiling into 
the doctor’s consultation room. Moreover, the health-care unit had only one entry and exit, making 
the building a fire-safety hazard (the windows were all barred and could not be opened), which was 
a cause of constant concern for the staff.  
 
 The CPT recommends that steps be taken to remedy the above-mentioned deficiencies 
with a view to ensuring that the health-care services are located in premises fit for purpose. 
 
 
b. medical screening, recording of injuries and confidentiality 
 
 
93. The CPT is obliged to reiterate the importance of medical screening of newly arrived 
prisoners, in particular in the interests of identifying special medical needs, preventing the spread of 
transmissible diseases, suicide prevention and the timely recording of any injuries. Such screening 
should be carried out as soon as possible and no later than 24 hours after a prisoner’s admission to 
the establishment. 
  

- 51 - 
The results of every examination, including the above-mentioned statements and the 
doctor’s opinions/observations, should be made available to the prisoner and, with the consent 
of the prisoner, to his or her lawyer. Further, the existing procedures be reviewed in order to 
ensure that whenever injuries are recorded which are consistent with allegations of 
ill-treatment made by a prisoner (or which, even in the absence of allegations, are indicative 
of ill-treatment), the report is immediately brought to the attention of the relevant prosecutor 
regardless of the wishes of the person concerned. 
 
 
96. As regards medical confidentiality, the CPT’s delegation found that it was rarely respected. 
Medical examinations took place in the presence of custodial staff, who wandered freely around the 
medical unit and were even present when physical examinations of prisoners were being carried 
out. Further, there was no confidentiality of medical records; custodial staff had access to the 
records and some records were left lying about the medical unit in full view of prisoners and 
custodial staff. There is a need to completely review medical confidentiality at KIA. 
 
 The CPT recommends that steps be taken to ensure that medical consultations at KIA 
guarantee medical confidentiality (i.e. that the medical examination is conducted out of the 
hearing and – unless the doctor concerned expressly requests otherwise in a given case – out 
of the sight of non-medical staff).  
 
Further, the CPT recommends that steps be taken to guarantee the confidentiality of 
medical data within the prison. Health-care staff may inform custodial officers on a need-to-
know basis about the state of health of a detained person; however, the information 
provided should be limited to that necessary to prevent a serious risk for the detained person 
or other persons, unless the detained person consents to additional information being given. 
 
 
97. The delegation also observed that nursing staff prepared medication in weekly dosage boxes 
which were subsequently distributed by prison officers up to three times a day. Consequently, 
medication and its dosage are clearly visible to the custodial staff. Such a practice could 
compromise medical confidentiality requirements and does not contribute to the proper 
establishment of a doctor-patient relationship. In the CPT’s view, medication should be distributed 
by health-care staff.  
 
 The CPT recommends that the authorities draw up a list of medication that should in 
every case be distributed by health-care staff (such as anti-psychotics, methadone and 
antiretroviral drugs) and to put in place procedures for the distribution of other medication 
that guarantees confidentiality. Further, the health-care service should ensure that the drugs 
chart, showing which prisoner was provided with which medication and when, is properly 
maintained, and that all missed medication dosages are recorded.  
  

- 53 - 
Further, the CPT has again noted that solitary confinement was invariably accompanied by 
the corollary punishment of withdrawal of permission to use the telephone and to receive visits. The 
Committee has stated clearly that prisoners undergoing a punishment of solitary confinement as a 
disciplinary sanction should never be totally deprived of contacts with their families and any 
restrictions on such contacts should be imposed only where the offence relates to such contacts. It 
should also be remembered that family members have a right to retain contact under Article 8 of the 
European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, prisoners should be entitled to at least one 
hour of outdoor exercise per day. Consequently, Article 56 of the 2005 Prisons Law should be 
amended accordingly. 
 
The CPT recommends that the 2005 Prisons Law of Aruba in relation to disciplinary 
matters be revised accordingly, taking into account the above remarks.  
 
 
101. The segregation unit, consisting of five cells, was located next to the section for high-
security prisoners. At the time of the visit, one person was being held in segregation for a 10-day 
disciplinary punishment. The cell (measuring some 12 m² and 6m high) was in a state of 
dilapidation, dirty, flooded with water, humid and very poorly ventilated. Access to natural light 
was extremely limited and the artificial lighting was insufficient for reading without straining the 
eyes; the metal sheeting covering the cell bars prevented light from entering the cell and impeded 
the little ventilation available in the unit. The toilet did not function and was constantly leaking 
water into the cell. There were no staff on duty in the unit and no call bell which meant that 
58
prisoners had to shout or throw water into the corridor to catch the attention of the staff 
monitoring the corridor of the unit with CCTV. In sum, the conditions were unfit for holding human 
beings. 
 
 The CPT’s delegation made an immediate observation under Article 8, paragraph 5, of the 
Convention in relation to these cells and requested that, until such time as these cells are provided 
with sufficient access to natural light and adequate ventilation, they should no longer be used for 
accommodating prisoners. Further, the cleanliness and hygiene in the disciplinary section must be 
radically improved. 
 
 By letter of 24 September 2014, the Aruban authorities responded that action had been taken 
to improve the ventilation and hygiene in these cells. Although the renovation of KIA as a whole 
was a priority for the Ministry of Justice, the financial situation in Aruba meant that there was 
currently no funding available. Nevertheless, this matter had been raised with the Dutch Ministry of 
Security and Justice with a view to finding a solution.  
 
The CPT has taken note of this response. However, it considers that action is still 
required before these cells are adequate for accommodating prisoners. The CPT recommends 
that the cells in the segregation unit be provided with sufficient access to natural light and 
adequate artificial lighting, and the defective toilets repaired. Further, all cells should be 
equipped with a call-bell.   
 
 
  
                                                 
58
  Prisoners were provided with a bucket of water with which to wash and to flush the toilet. 

- 55 - 
In this context, the delegation received a number of complaints from foreign national 
prisoners about the limited possibilities of contact with their families. The CPT wishes to re-
emphasise the need for some flexibility as regards the application of rules on visits vis-à-vis 
prisoners whose families live far away. Such prisoners should be allowed to accumulate visiting 
time and be given more opportunities to have telephone contacts with their families. 
 
 The CPT recommends that accumulated visiting time for prisoners who receive 
infrequent visits be put in place and that steps be taken to increase prisoners’ access to the 
telephone. Further, the 2005 Prisons Law should be amended to provide prisoners with at least 
one hour of visit time each week and increased access to the telephone. Consideration should 
also be given to exploring the use of communication through Voice over Internet Protocol for 
foreign national prisoners. 
 
 
c. complaints and inspection procedures 
 
 
106. A Prison Supervisory Committee was competent to receive complaints from prisoners at 
KIA and its members could visit prisoners at any time. However, the Supervisory Committee has 
not been functioning since December 2013 following the resignation of its Chairman, a judge from 
the Joint Court of Justice and the Committee’s only paid member. Action should be taken to 
reconstitute the Supervisory Committee as soon as possible and to ensure that it functions 
effectively to examine prisoners’ complaints (i.e. that the members of the Committee are properly 
trained to fulfil their tasks and fully understand the independent nature of their mandate). 
 
Within the prison, complaints were handled by the Head of Social Services and the Director 
of the Prison, with most matters resolved through oral communication with prisoners. However, it 
was not possible to obtain written information on the meetings of the internal prison complaints 
committee (i.e. the minutes). Further, in one case relating to inter-prisoner violence where prison 
officers had apparently allowed the gates between two sections to remain open, thus enabling one 
inmate to attack another inmate, the Head of Social Services had written to the Ministry of Justice 
and the Prison Director seeking action but had not received a response. 
 
 Many prisoners met by the delegation had little confidence in the complaints process and 
stated that they often did not receive any response. Others did not know about how to make a 
complaint and there were no specific complaints forms available. 
 
The CPT considers that the existing internal complaints system needs to be reviewed; for 
example, prisoners ought to be able to make written complaints at any moment and place them in a 
locked complaints box on a prison landing (forms should be freely available); all written complaints 
should be registered centrally within the prison before being allocated to a particular service for 
investigation or follow up. In all cases, the investigation should be carried out expeditiously (with 
any delays justified) and prisoners should be informed within clearly defined time periods of the 
action taken to address their concern or of the reasons for considering the complaint not justified. In 
addition, statistics on the types of complaints made should be kept as an indicator to management of 
areas of discontent within the prison. Of course, prison officers should be encouraged and 
empowered as far as possible to resolve complaints themselves and if this is not possible recourse to 
a written procedure should be promoted.

D. Psychiatric Department (PAAZ) at Dr Horacio Oduber Hospital 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
60
108. The PAAZ, located in a separate building on the grounds of Dr Horacio Oduber Hospital, 
is the only mental health-care institution in Aruba where patients subject to an involuntary 
placement order may be accommodated. PAAZ consists of four units set out around a large garden 
courtyard: a nine-bed admission unit, a 10-bed follow-up unit, a 21-bed long-stay unit and a 15-
place day-care unit). At the time of the visit, the department was accommodating 32 patients. 
  
 The CPT’s delegation undertook a targeted visit to the admission unit, the only closed ward 
of the clinic, which was accommodating seven patients, two of whom were being held on an 
involuntary basis.  
 
At the outset, the CPT wishes to state that the PAAZ department appeared to be a caring, 
well-run and supportive, therapeutic establishment. The delegation received no allegations of ill-
treatment by staff.  
 
 
2. Patients’ living conditions and treatment 
 
 
109. The living conditions in the admission unit were of a satisfactory nature, with the four 
double-occupancy rooms and two single-occupancy rooms, all of an adequate size, suitably 
furnished, bright and airy. Patients had access to a large sitting and dining room area at one end of 
the unit where they could relax, watch television, smoke and take their meals. The bathroom and 
toilet areas were clean and hygienic. Patients had access to a large inner garden area every day for 
one or two hours, and could also meet their visitors there. 
 
 Two isolation rooms were located at the far end of the unit. 
 
 
110. As for treatment, each patient had an individual care plan drawn up which was reviewed on 
a weekly basis by a psychiatrist. A broad range of treatment was offered, including 
pharmacotherapy, individual and group psychotherapy, occupational therapy (art, music), group 
sessions and a range of activities.  
 
 Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) was not applied but patients could be sent to Curaçao for 
such treatment if considered necessary.

  PAAZ stands for Psychiatrische Afdeling Algemeen Ziekenhuis (Psychiatric Department of General Hospital). 

- 59 - 
5. Safeguards 
 
 
a. initial placement procedure 
 
 
113. The procedure by which involuntary placement is decided should offer guarantees of 
independence and impartiality as well as of objective medical expertise. Leaving aside emergency 
cases, the formal decision to place a person in a psychiatric hospital should always be based on the 
opinion of at least one doctor with psychiatric qualifications, and preferably two and the actual 
placement decision should be taken by a different body from the one that recommended it. Further, a 
patient must have the right to appeal the measure to a court or mental health tribunal; which should 
see the patient before deciding on the involuntary placement measure if this is possible and not 
detrimental to the person’s health. The patient should also be entitled to legal assistance in such 
proceedings. Where the patient does not appear before the judge, he or she should normally be 
represented by a person acting in his or her interests.  
 
 
114. The procedure for the involuntary placement of a civil nature in Aruba is regulated by 
61
Article 15 of the 1992 National Ordinance on Mental Health which provides for the Minister of 
Health to authorise an involuntary placement based upon the statement of a psychiatrist. The form 
the psychiatrist must complete was provided for by Article 8(3) of the 1992 Ordinance and 
continues to be used despite Article 8 of the Law having been abrogated. The form requires a 
statement of the symptoms, a diagnosis, the time and date the doctor last saw the patient, how often 
the patient has been seen by the doctor or another person and any other relevant information. The 
same form is used for the renewal of an involuntary placement order. In an emergency, a nurse may 
sign the order but a doctor must then see the patient within 24 hours.  
 
 Patients are not allowed to see the form drawn up by the doctor but may write to the 
Minister of Health to oppose an application, if they are informed that such an application is being 
made. They may also call a lawyer which does not occur often and in one recent case the lawyer 
advised the patient against mounting a challenge to the order after seeing for himself that the patient 
was ill. Further, patients do not receive any written reasons for decisions on involuntary placement 
unless they request them specifically, and there is no procedure for a hearing to be held. Moreover, 
there is no legal remedy to challenge the involuntary placement. 
 
 The above-mentioned procedures clearly fall short of providing adequate safeguards for 
patients subject to a measure of involuntary placement. A proper legal framework regulating this 
matter needs to be adopted.  
 
The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities review the procedures for 
involuntary placement at PAAZ in order to meet the standards set out in paragraph 113 
above.

  Krankzinnigenverordening (AB 1992 no. GT 15) which translates literally as “Lunatic Ordinance”. 

- 61 - 
116. A leaflet containing basic information on the house rules of the admission unit existed 
(including inter alia information on meals, treatment, visiting times for patients). However, the 
leaflet did not refer to issues such as consent to treatment, access to legal assistance or how to file 
complaints. Further it was not systematically provided to patients.  
The CPT recommends that the leaflet at the PAAZ admission unit be revised in light of 
the comments above. Patients unable to understand the information leaflet should receive 
appropriate assistance. 
 
 
117. The maintenance of contact with the outside world is essential, not only for the prevention of 
ill-treatment but also from a therapeutic standpoint. Patients should be able to send and receive 
correspondence, to have access to the telephone, and to receive visits from their family and friends. 
Confidential communication with a lawyer should also be guaranteed.  
 
All these requirements seemed to be met. In particular, the CPT’s delegation noted that 
patients had the right to receive visitors every afternoon for one to two hours, and that they were 
permitted to make two telephone calls a day, including by mobile phone if they possessed one. 
 
 
118. The possibility for patients to address complaints to independent external monitoring bodies 
remains a cornerstone of the basic rights of any involuntarily admitted psychiatric patient. However, 
besides being able to address complaints internally to the PAAZ management and to the hospital 
complaints department, the delegation was informed that there was no independent monitoring body 
either visiting PAAZ or dealing with complaints. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Aruban authorities ensure that specific arrangements 
exist enabling patients to lodge formal complaints with a clearly designated body, and to 
communicate on a confidential basis with an independent outside authority. 
  

- 63 - 
120. Detention up to ten days at police stations still occurs in Curaçao. However, the CPT found 
that the current practice was for persons to be held at police stations for a couple of days at most 
(often only a few hours) before being transferred to a specific unit for persons still under police 
custody at the prison, SDKK.  
 
The CPT welcomes the steps taken by the authorities of Curaçao to institute a practice of 
transferring persons in police custody from police premises to the prison within a few days of 
apprehension. However, although the detained persons were held in a prison block operated by 
prison staff, in fact the police continued to exercise full authority over these persons. It appeared 
that prison staff at Block 1 could not enter the cells without permission from the police, even in the 
case of a medical emergency.  
 
The CPT recommends that police custody does not exceed the initial period of two 
days (inverzekeringstelling) and that any further extensions of detention are carried out at 
SDKK. Further, once a detained person has been physically transferred to the prison, full 
authority over their care should be transferred to prison staff and Block 1 should be formally 
integrated into the prison structure. 
 
 
121. Moreover, the delegation found that police stations continue to be used in exceptional 
circumstances for holding prisoners for extended periods of time, apparently for reasons of 
protection. A review of the registers showed that a number of persons had been held for three 
months or more. A former police officer awaiting extradition had spent 120 days at Barber Police 
Station, while a suspect in a high profile case had spent eight months at Barber before being 
transferred to SDKK on 12 May 2014. Rio Canario Police Station held another suspect in the same 
case from 29 October 2013 and following his conviction on 29 August 2014 he continued to be held 
there.  
 
A new unit for separation and protection of prisoners at SDKK was due to be brought into 
service in the near future. The delegation was told that this unit should put an end to all forms of 
long-term detention at police stations. 
 
The CPT would like to be informed whether the new unit at SDKK is now operational 
and, if so, what regime is in place. Further, it wishes to receive confirmation that long-term 
detention of prisoners no longer takes place in police stations.  
 
 
122. The delegation visited the police stations of Barber and Rio Canario, as well as Block 1 of 
71
SDKK. 
 
 
  
                                                 
71
  The CPT previously visited Punda Police Station during its visits in 1994 (CPT/Inf (96) 1) and in 2007 
(CPT/Inf (2008) 2); however, at the time of the 2014 visit it was no longer used for detaining suspects. 

- 65 - 
126.  Several efforts to address ill-treatment by police officials have been undertaken since the 
previous CPT visit, including the issuing of guidelines on the investigation of complaints against 
72
the police and the introduction of a training course for police officers on use of force, arrest and 
self-defence skills and use of firearms. These measures have contributed to a decrease in the 
number of allegations of police ill-treatment since the 2007 visit. Nevertheless, the CPT wishes to 
stress that it is important for the authorities to remain vigilant and pursue their efforts to completely 
root out ill-treatment.  
 
An overview of complaints of ill-treatment by police officers reported to the public 
prosecutor showed 17 cases in 2009, 57 in 2010, 15 in 2011, 23 in 2012 (of which two were 
prosecuted as acts of torture), and 17 in 2013. Of the 17 cases in 2013, most complaints involved 
allegations of either a push or a slap by a police officer.  
 
The CPT would like to be informed of the disciplinary/criminal sanctions imposed in 
respect of the complaints of police ill-treatment for the years 2010 to 2014 inclusive.  
 
 
3. Safeguards against ill-treatment 
 
 
a. introduction 
 
 
127. The CPT attaches particular importance to three fundamental safeguards for persons 
deprived of their liberty by the police: the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or 
another person of their choice of their situation; the right of access to a lawyer; and the right of 
access to a doctor. These three rights represent fundamental safeguards against the ill-treatment of 
persons deprived of their liberty, which should apply from the very outset of custody. In addition, it 
is important that all detained persons are informed of their rights in a language they understand. 
 
 
b. notification of custody 
 
 
128. Under the Code of Conduct and Use of Force Instructions for the Police Force of the 
73
Netherlands Antilles a police officer shall immediately inform a relative or household member of 
the detained person’s arrest. If the detained person is a minor the police shall do this on their own 
initiative. However, if the detained person is an adult, notification shall be made only upon request. 
If circumstances prevent the police from doing so when a detained person is not a resident of 
74
Curaçao, the consulate of the country of which he/she is a resident should be notified of the arrest. 
 
Most persons interviewed indicated that their right to promptly inform a close relative or 
another person of their choice of their arrest had been respected. Notification is mostly performed 
by the police, however, as restrictions on contact with the outside world exist in most cases during 
the first 10 days of detention.

(hereinafter Police Code of Conduct).

  Article 12 of the Police Code of Conduct. 

- 67 - 
d. access to a doctor 
 
 
131. According to Article 17 of the Police Code of Conduct, a doctor shall be consulted in the 
case of a specific request to see a doctor or when a detained person is clearly ill or injured. The 
information gathered during the visit suggests that detained persons were able to consult a doctor if 
needed. 
 
However, the delegation did receive complaints from persons in police custody who were 
held in Block 1 in SDKK. Whenever a detained person requested medical attention, prison officers 
had to call a police doctor or nurse. Such a procedure can cause serious delay and is completely 
unnecessary given the fact that the prison has its own medical service.  
 
In the context of the CPT’s overall recommendation to place Block 1 under the full authority 
of SDKK (see paragraph 120), the CPT recommends that the medical care for all persons held 
in Block 1 be placed under the responsibility of the prison health-care service. 
 
 
132. The delegation further found that no medical screening was performed on detained persons 
arriving at Block 1. Prompt medical screening of newly arrived detained persons is essential to 
prevent the spread of transmissible diseases and for recording injuries in good time. Medical 
screening can also be used to identify mental illness, addictions and dietary needs. 
 
The CPT recommends that every newly admitted prisoner to SDKK be medically 
assessed (see also paragraph 167). 
 
 
133. Curaçao is a major trafficking point for the transportation of cocaine emanating from South 
America and destined for North America and Europe. Drug trafficking by body-packers (bolita- or 
bolletjesslikkers) continues to be a serious problem. The Rio Canario Police Station was designated 
to hold these suspects. In 2005, the cell block was fitted with special toilets to recover drugs that 
were swallowed or otherwise inserted into the body. In addition to specialised equipment, however, 
detention of suspected body-packers requires appropriate medical supervision, due to the serious 
risk of acute intoxication and obstruction of the intestines, both of which may lead to death. 
Laxatives were administered by police officers without guidance from health professionals, which 
can be dangerous given the risk of side effects and contraindications leading to medical 
complications.  
 
The CPT recommends that appropriate medical supervision always be made available 
for the detention of suspected body-packers. It would further like to receive information on 
the temporary airport facility for the detention of body-packers and the treatment and care 
protocols in place there, as well as in the new cells at Rio Canario Police Station. 
 
  

- 69 - 
g. custody records 
 
 
136. In the report on the 2007 visit, the CPT noted that custody recording practices varied 
considerably from one police station to another, none providing a comprehensive custody record. It 
recommended that authorities consider the possibility of drawing up an individualised custody 
record for use at all police stations and including all aspects of custody, as well as all measures 
77
taken in connection with it. Since then, the comprehensive ICT application ACTPOL has been 
78
developed and made available for use at all police stations. The CPT welcomes the introduction of 
this system. However, on a number of occasions it appeared that only basic information was 
recorded, leaving out other actions relating to detained persons (e.g. visits received, requests made 
and incidents). 
 
The CPT recommends that clear guidelines on the use of the system be introduced, in 
the light of the above remarks.  
 
 
137. The CPT found that individual custody records, both at police stations and at Block 1 at 
SDKK, often only included a copy of the first warrant for police custody (bevel tot 
inverzekeringstelling), while further warrants could not be found. It appeared that extension of 
custody was communicated by the prosecutor by phone, but police and prison officials were not 
provided with a copy of the valid warrant.  
   
The CPT recommends that a valid warrant, providing the legal basis for custody, 
always be kept in the individual custody record of a detained person. A valid warrant should 
automatically be provided by the authority ordering the custody to the authority responsible 
for executing it.  
 
 
4. Conditions of detention 
 
 
138. In the report on the 2007 visit, the conditions of detention in Barber Police Station were 
79
severely criticised. At the time of the 2014 visit, the delegation observed that this facility had been 
renovated.  
 
An in-cell call-bell system had been installed, as well as three surveillance cameras in the 
corridors of the detention block. Air-conditioning now ensured comfortable temperatures. The cell 
block consists of ten cells, each measuring some 6.5 m² and equipped with in-cell semi-partitioned 
toilet and shower; eight of the cells had two beds. However, access to natural light was very limited. 
The CPT notes that cells under 7 m² provide limited space for one person and are absolutely 
inadequate for keeping more than one detained person for overnight detention. 
                                                 
77
  See the report on the 2007 visit (CPT/Inf (2008) 2), Part 3, paragraph 27.  
78
  ACTPOL can be used to register at least the following information in individualised files: general information 
(name of detained person, date and time of start and end of custody, ID number of the commanding officer and 
status), the charge, searches performed and personal goods taken into possession, limitations, cell occupation, 
transfers, dietary needs (including type of food, quantity, times, allergies), medical information (including 
medication needed, where medication is kept and when and how it should be provided), health insurance 
information, financial transactions relating to the detained person, and other relevant information, such as cell 
searches, visitors, requests of the detained person, phone calls made on behalf of the detained person, etc. 
79
  See the report on the 2007 visit (CPT/Inf (2008) 2), Part 3, paragraph 19 and 20. 

- 71 - 
141. Detained persons in Block 1 had no access to television, radio or newspapers and no 
activities were offered. Access to the outdoor exercise yard (56 m²) for one hour per day was 
provided if more than one prison officer was present. The yard was equipped with a basketball ring, 
but no seats or shelter from the sun or rain. Indeed, while each shift was supposed to have four 
officers, often only two were present and about twice a week only one officer was on duty. The 
delegation further observed that extensive restrictions, including on contact with the outside world, 
are almost automatically imposed by the prosecutor for the first ten days of detention.  
 
The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities ensure that all detained persons 
are offered a minimum of one hour of outdoor exercise every day. Further, an improved 
regime should be put in place as detention at Block 1 generally lasted up to ten days and often 
even longer. 
 
The CPT also recommends that the regulations governing access to visits, telephone 
calls, newspapers, radio and television are reviewed in order to ensure restrictions are 
imposed only when required to protect the legitimate interests of the police investigation, 
assessed on a case by case basis, in accordance with Article 90(1) of the CCP. 
 
 
142. The police stations of Barber and Rio Canario continued to be used for longer periods of 
detention whenever certain prisoners were considered to be at risk among the general population at 
SDKK. 
 
80
 One person interviewed by the delegation claimed that he had been held at Barber Police 
Station in complete isolation for 40 days, after which he had been allowed to go for outdoor 
exercise together with other detained persons. He said that the only reading material permitted was 
a bible and that he had received a small radio after seven months. He further claimed to have been 
without a blanket for two months. Conditions such as these, which are akin to solitary confinement, 
could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment.  
 
 Another person interviewed indicated that he had been held at Rio Canario Police Station for 
eight months, with no radio or television or reading materials. He had access to outdoor exercise for 
two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon in the large exercise yard.  
 
The CPT reiterates that the conditions of detention at police stations are completely 
inadequate for long-term detention.  
 
The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities make every effort to find 
alternative solutions to long-term detention at police stations, such as the use of a special unit 
within SDKK (see also paragraph 185).  
 
  
                                                 
80
  This person was held at Barber Police Station from 20 September 2013 until 12 May 2014, when he was 
transferred to a general population block at SDKK. While authorities claimed that his placement there was for 
his own protection, the fact that he was consequently transferred to a general population block would appear to 
belie this argument. The detained person claimed that his conditions of detention were designed to pressure 
him to confess as he had stated explicitly that he had no problems with being held at SDKK and had formally 
requested transfers at least twice.

B. Centre for Detention and Correction Curaçao - SDKK 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
144. The prison, located in the neighbourhood of Koraal Specht, and formerly known as Bon 
Futuro, changed its name in 2010 to Centre for Detention and Correction Curaçao (Sentro di 
Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou or SDKK). This was the CPT’s sixth visit to this establishment. In 
its report on the 2007 visit, the CPT stated that it had received several allegations of physical ill-
treatment by prison staff, most of them involving an intervention by members of the Correctional 
Emergency Response Team (CERT). It had further expressed serious concerns with regard to the 
problem of inter-prisoner violence. Material conditions in the disciplinary unit were severely 
criticised, as was the absence of a call-bell system. 
 
 
145. The official capacity at SDKK was 674 (similar to the number in 2007). However, the actual 
capacity had been drastically reduced due to many cells being out of commission as they were not 
considered fit for human occupation. At the time of the visit, SDKK had a total of 399 places, 
including the psychiatric unit, high security unit, women’s unit and the semi-open unit for men, and 
81
was holding 332 inmates, with all 298 places in the general population blocks occupied. 
 
 
146.  In June 2010, as part of preparations for the constitutional changes of the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands, it was agreed that Curaçao would have to develop a specific action plan (Plan van 
Aanpak) with regard to certain institutions and report regularly on the implementation of these 
plans. The action plan for SDKK included plans to improve the physical state of the prison, the 
security of the prison, the regime for and treatment of prisoners, and the correction and reintegration 
function of the prison, as well as its management. Implementation of this plan has clearly had a 
82
positive impact on SDKK to date. However, much work remains to be done.   
 
 
147. At the outset, the CPT would like to note that it observed gaps in documentation held by the 
prison administration at SDKK. The delegation found that files of unsentenced prisoners generally 
did not contain any written warrants providing a legal basis for their detention, as extensions of 
detention were being communicated by the Prosecutor’s Office by phone. Further, there were no 
registers regarding incidents, use of force, use of means of restraint, injuries or complaints. The 
delegation also found irregularities in the list of prisoners, such as the inclusion of a certain prisoner 
who had already been released more than a month earlier and another prisoner who had been 
transferred to the Netherlands two months earlier. 
 
Proper administration and documentation is crucial for effective prison management.  
 
The CPT recommends that a full review of the record-keeping system at SDKK be 
carried out, including the introduction of the above-mentioned registers and full 
documentation of the legal basis for the detention of each individual held at SDKK. 
  
                                                 
81
  These are the numbers reflected in the official documents provided to the delegation, dated 4 May 2014. 
82
  For example, security had improved through the construction of a separate entrance outside the main prison 
premises where visitors are checked and goods are being received. 

- 75 - 
3. Conditions of detention 
 
 
a. material conditions 
 
 
150.  The CPT noted some improvements of the material conditions in comparison to previous 
visits. Nevertheless, serious problems remained in a number of blocks (particularly Blocks 2, 7B 
and 8) which were in a bad state of repair and had sewage problems, escalating the poor hygiene 
conditions and causing a foul stench. Some efforts were being made to control pests, but these 
appeared to be inadequate given the presence of rats, cockroaches, pigeons and other pests. Many of 
the cells were out of use due to leaks and other problems, creating a health hazard. Stagnant water 
provided a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The Prison Supervisory Committee (Commissie van 
Toezicht) had warned that fire safety measures were not in place and that the necessary equipment 
and security checks were not performed regularly; this was confirmed by the delegation. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the necessary steps be taken to refurbish and improve the 
material conditions at SDKK in the light of the above remarks.  
 
 
b. regime 
 
 
151. According to an overview of available workplaces in 2013, the number of places per month 
fluctuated between 178 and 201, roughly two-thirds of which related to cleaning. There were 
approximately 35 places in the different workshops (sewing, carpentry, car mechanics and 
upholstery), between 7 and 15 places in maintenance, around 20 places in the kitchen. The overview 
does not show, however, for how many hours per day or week a certain prisoner is actually engaged 
in labour for each of these functions. 
 
 The building and refurbishing of workshops, a fitness centre, a computer room and 
classrooms had created more physical space for purposeful activities. The schedule of regular 
activities provided to the delegation showed that every block had access at least once a week to 
sports, fitness, the library and spiritual development (BGV).  
 
 Moreover, the programme of education on offer as of January 2014 included classes on 
social skills (for those nearing their release date), computer skills, handicrafts, literacy (Papiamentu) 
83
and finally music classes for those in JoVo and FOBA.  
 
 
152. Certainly, the number of activities being offered represented a major step forward compared 
to the situation found in 2007. Nevertheless, the delegation received numerous complaints from 
prisoners about the lack of activities on offer, particularly educational and work opportunities, and 
observed that most prisoners spent their days in a situation of enforced idleness. Many prisoners 
stated that they did not have any opportunity to work or study. The offer of vocational courses 
appeared to be sporadic, offering a certain class for a couple of months which was subsequently no 
longer available for a while. The delegation found that shortage of both staff on post and other 
resources seriously affected access to activities.  
                                                 
83
  See explanation in paragraph 171. 

- 77 - 
 The CPT recommends that juveniles not be held at SDKK, but exclusively 
accommodated at a juvenile institution.  
 
 
d.  women prisoners 
 
 
156. The unit for women at SDKK had a capacity of 55 places, plus five disciplinary cells and a 
baby room. The baby room was last used in July 2013 when a baby was allowed to stay with its 
mother for two months. The Prison Supervisory Committee informed the delegation that they had 
repeatedly raised the issue of the development of a specific policy for babies in prison. At the time 
of the visit, no such policy was in place. 
 
In the view of the CPT, the governing principle in all cases must be the welfare of the child.  
This implies in particular that any ante- and post-natal care provided in custody should be 
equivalent to that available in the outside community.  Where babies and young children are held in 
custodial settings, their treatment should be supervised by specialists in social work and child 
development.  The goal should be to produce a child-centred environment, free as far as possible 
from visible signs of incarceration, such as uniforms and jangling keys.  
 
The CPT recommends that an adequate policy on babies in prison be developed 
bearing in mind the above considerations. 
 
 
157. At the time of the visit, there were eight female prisoners. The set-up of the unit remains the 
84
same as that described in the report on the 2007 visit, generally providing satisfactory material 
conditions, although there were complaints of rats and crabs in the block at night. Since the 2007 
visit, the disciplinary cells had been renovated. However, the shower and toilet were too close to 
each other for hygienic conditions to be maintained. 
 
The CPT recommends that the design of the sanitary facilities be changed so that the 
toilet is separate from the shower. 
 
 
158. Activities offered to female prisoners included classes on handicrafts, sewing, manicure, 
pedicure and hairdressing. Some women were offered cleaning jobs for a few hours a day. The 
women complained that they were not offered sufficient schooling opportunities and were not 
adequately prepared for their release. They further expressed dissatisfaction with medical care and a 
lack of psychological support.  
 
Women deprived of their liberty should enjoy access to meaningful activities (work, 
training, education, sport, etc.). The female prisoners at SDKK should not only be offered activities 
which have been deemed "appropriate" for them (such as sewing and handicrafts), whilst male 
prisoners are offered training of a more vocational nature. In the view of the CPT, such a 
discriminatory approach can only serve to reinforce outmoded stereotypes of the social role of 
women.  
                                                 
84
  See the report on the 2007 visit (CPT/Inf (2008) 2), Part 3, paragraph 47. 

- 79 - 
In the light of the above remarks, the CPT welcomes the large scale retraining of 140 prison 
‘guards’ into prison ‘officers’ and recommends that all prison officers be offered regular in-
service training. 
 
 
5. Health-care services 
 
 
161. The CPT recalls that the task of prison health-care services should not be limited to treating 
sick prisoners. They should also be entrusted with responsibility for social and preventive medicine. 
In particular, a prison health-care service should ensure that information about transmissible 
diseases is regularly circulated, to both prisoners and prison staff. Suicide prevention is another 
matter falling within the purview of a prison’s health-care service. Further, it lies with prison 
health-care services to supervise catering arrangements (quantity, quality, preparation and 
distribution of food) and conditions of hygiene. Provision of medical, nursing and technical staff, as 
well as premises, installations and equipment, should be geared accordingly. 
 
 The findings of the 2014 visit demonstrate that there remain a number of important 
structural deficiencies in the provision of health care to prisoners. 
 
 
a. staffing, premises, financing and organisation 
 
 
162. The medical service at SDKK was staffed by two part-time doctors ensuring a doctor’s 
88
presence only between 10 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on weekdays. Outside these hours they are on call 
on a rota basis. This is totally insufficient for a prison with an operating capacity of more than 400 
places. At a minimum, the prison should benefit from the equivalent of a full-time doctor. 
Moreover, only three of the seven full-time nursing positions were filled, since four nurses left in 
2012; one of the three will retire in 2015. A dentist visits twice a week from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.  
 
The lack of staff meant that the shift system in place at the time of the visit resulted in a 
situation where no health-care staff were present at the prison between the hours of 6 p.m. and 8 
a.m. on weekdays, and for the entire weekend.  
 
A psychiatrist attended SDKK (apart from FOBA, see paragraphs 172 and 173) one day a 
week, which is insufficient for a population of more than 330 prisoners, many of who have mental 
health issues. Prisoners did not benefit from psychological care (one psychologist attended only the 
FOBA unit). In the CPT’s view, an establishment of the size of SDKK should be able to rely on the 
services of at least one full-time psychologist.  
 
The CPT calls upon the Curaçao authorities to ensure that efforts be made to secure 
the equivalent of at least one full-time doctor at SDKK and that steps be taken to fill the 
vacant posts for nurses. 
 
The CPT further recommends that steps be taken to ensure that a member of the 
health-care staff is present every day, including at weekends, and that someone qualified to 
provide first aid always be present in the prison, including at night. 
                                                 
88
  One doctor visits the prison on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the other doctor on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays. 

- 81 - 
166. Regarding the administration of the medical service, the delegation observed that 
consultation requests, medical information and treatment were kept in separate files, rather than 
keeping them together in a single patient medical file. Further, information regarding treatment and 
findings by external specialists was not kept at all. There was also no clear order (for example 
chronological) in the files and there was no electronic record-keeping. The delegation found that the 
administration of medical files and data did not allow a clear overview on the quality of care.  
 
The CPT recommends that the administration of the medical service be reorganised, 
ensuring that all relevant information in relation to a patient can be found in his or her 
personal medical file. 
 
 
b. medical screening, recording of injuries and confidentiality 
 
 
167. Prompt medical screening of newly arrived prisoners is essential to prevent the spread of 
transmissible diseases and for recording injuries in good time. Medical screening can also be used 
to identify mental illness, addictions and dietary needs.  The CPT noted that medical screening was 
generally carried out days, weeks, and even months after the prisoner’s arrival, with some prisoners 
claiming that they were never checked at all; this is not acceptable. Further, the screening generally 
only consisted of an interview on the personal and family history of diseases and upon suspicion of 
HIV or hepatitis C or B, blood samples were taken and sent to the laboratory, with the consent of 
the prisoner. 
 
89
The CPT reiterates its recommendation that every newly admitted prisoner be 
properly interviewed and physically examined by a medical doctor (or by a fully qualified 
nurse reporting to a doctor) as soon as possible after his or her admission; save for 
exceptional circumstances, the interview/examination should be carried out within 24 hours.  
 
 
168. The delegation noted that no guidelines or procedures exist at SDKK for the systematic 
identification of ill-treatment. The CPT has consistently pointed out that prison health-care services 
can make a significant contribution to the prevention of ill-treatment of detained persons through, 
inter alia, the systematic recording of injuries, whether vis-à-vis new arrivals or following a violent 
episode in prison.  
 
The CPT recommends that measures be taken to ensure that the record drawn up 
after the medical examination of a prisoner – whether newly arrived or following a violent 
incident in prison – contains:  
 
(i) an account of statements made by the person which are relevant to the medical 
examination (including his/her description of his/her state of health and any allegations 
of ill-treatment);  
(ii) a full account of objective medical findings based on a thorough examination;  
(iii) the doctor’s observations in the light of i) and ii) indicating the consistency 
between any allegations made and the objective medical findings.  
 
 
                                                 
89
  See the report on the 2007 visit (CPT/Inf (2008) 2), Part 3, paragraph 56.  

- 83 - 
d. FOBA 
 
 
172. The forensic psychiatric support unit (forensische observatie- en begeleidingsafdeling or 
FOBA) continued to offer good material conditions in the two-storey building, as well as a positive 
atmosphere. FOBA accommodates remand prisoners for observation purposes upon order of the 
investigating judge, as well as sentenced prisoners who have been diagnosed with serious mental 
disorders.  However, it appeared that FOBA also continued to be used to hold prisoners considered 
to be at risk among the general population, particularly juveniles. At the time of the visit, FOBA 
had a capacity of 23 beds; occupancy on the first day of the visit was 19, of which 17 had been 
diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder and two others were juveniles (15 and 16 years old) who were 
90
placed there by order of the prosecutor.  
 
The CPT recommends that placements at FOBA are exclusively made on the basis of 
medical criteria, by decision of the responsible psychiatrist.  
 
 
173. As regards treatment, the delegation found that the unit was well-managed and adequately 
equipped. Individual care plans were found in the medical files and patients were involved in the 
development together with the mentor, who is a member of the prison staff allocated to FOBA. The 
stock of medication was very good, with a wide range of new generation medication.  
 
Further, a psychologist and a psychiatrist visit three mornings a week and are on call 24/7 
for consultations regarding FOBA patients. Every Friday, a nurse prepares the medication for each 
patient, which is then distributed by prison officers. A social worker visits once a week and a nurse 
or a doctor visits the unit when somatic care is needed. The unit is run by prison officers and 
medical staff are only present at the times indicated above. The prison staff at FOBA were found to 
be dedicated and very well trained. 
 
The CPT recommends that medication is distributed exclusively by medical staff. 
 
 
174. The delegation was informed that instances of forced medication rarely occur, but when the 
need arises, assistance is called in from the internal assistance team (IBT) to keep a patient under 
control. In the CPT’s view, forced medication should always be administered in a hospital setting. 
 
The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities take the necessary steps to ensure 
that forced medication is never administered in a prison setting and that alternatives be put in 
place, surrounded by appropriate safeguards. 
 
 
175. As regards the regime, patients are offered outdoor exercise for four hours  a day (two in the 
morning and two in the afternoon) and have access to a range of activities, including sports three 
times a week, weekly music classes and other lessons including computer and social skills, 
gardening and spiritual formation.  
 
 
  
                                                 
90
  These juveniles had initially been placed at the Judicial Youth Institute, but after several escapes the prosecutor 
decided they should be moved to SDKK; due to their age, they were then placed in FOBA. 

- 85 - 
The CPT would like to receive the comments of the Curaçao authorities on this matter. 
It further recommends that steps be taken to ensure that the documentation and registers 
concerning disciplinary sanctions are properly maintained, accurately record the times of 
beginning and ending of the measure, and reflect all other aspects of custody (in particular, 
the precise location where a prisoner has been held). 
 
 
179. Complaints regarding disciplinary decisions, placement in segregation or denied requests for 
91
segregation can be addressed to the Prison Supervisory Committee’s Complaints Committee. In 
2013, this Committee received 15 complaints, of which seven were upheld, some on formal 
grounds, such as incomplete disciplinary decisions or investigation files. 
 
The Prison Supervisory Committee informed the delegation that disciplinary measures often 
included being denied the possibility to work. When a disciplinary measure was annulled following 
appeal, prisoners were often not given back their former work, as it would already have been 
redistributed to another prisoner. 
 
The CPT recommends that measures be taken to ensure that those who have been 
denied work as part of a disciplinary decision, are reinstated or otherwise compensated in 
order to redress the consequences of an annulled decision, in line with Article 44(5) of the 
National Ordinance on the Prison System. 
 
 
180. The CPT has further noted that solitary confinement was invariably accompanied by the 
corollary punishment of withdrawal of permission to use the telephone and to receive visits. The 
Committee has stated clearly that prisoners undergoing a punishment of solitary confinement as a 
disciplinary sanction should never be totally deprived of contacts with their families and that any 
restrictions on such contacts should be imposed only where the offence relates to such contacts. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities take the necessary steps to comply 
with such an approach. 
 
 
181. On a more positive note, the delegation found the refurbishment of the disciplinary cells in 
Block 6 to be a vast improvement of the situation prevailing at the time of the 2007 visit, providing 
better hygiene, sanitary facilities and access to natural light through the installation of new 
windows. The cells had not yet been brought back into service at the time of the visit. 
 
 The CPT would receive confirmation that these disciplinary cells have been brought 
back into service.    
 
  
                                                 
91
  Article 40 of the National Ordinance on the Prison System. 

- 87 - 
b. segregation of prisoners  
 
 
185. At the time of the visit, several prisoners who needed to be segregated for their own 
protection or the protection of others, were held at unsuitable locations. The delegation was shown a 
newly renovated block consisting of two floors with nine cells each, one floor for disciplinary 
purposes and the other for segregation. The delegation was informed that the second floor could 
also be used for protection purposes. The high security unit in Block 6, also used for segregation, 
was found by the delegation to be in a poor state of repair and in need of renovation. 
 
Every prison system has prisoners who may require protection from other prisoners. This 
may be because of the nature of their offence, their co-operation with the criminal justice 
authorities, inter-gang rivalry, debts outside or inside the prison or the general vulnerability of the 
person. While many prisoners can be managed in the general prison population in these 
circumstances, the risk to some is such that the prison can only discharge its duty of care to the 
individuals by keeping them apart from all other prisoners. This may be done at the prisoner’s own 
request or at the instigation of management when it is deemed necessary. States have an obligation 
to provide a safe environment for those confined to prison and should attempt to fulfil this 
obligation by allowing as much social interaction as possible among prisoners, consistent with the 
maintenance of good order. 
 
The CPT considers that prisoners placed in administrative solitary confinement for good 
order or protection should have an individual regime plan, geared to addressing the reasons for the 
measure. This plan should attempt to maximise contact with others – staff initially, but as soon as 
practicable with appropriate other prisoners – and provide as full a range of activities as is possible 
to fill the days.  
 
The CPT would like to receive confirmation that this new discipline and segregation 
block is now operational. It recommends that the Curaçao authorities draw up a policy for 
managing persons who have been placed under protection in the light of the above remarks. 
 
 
c. complaints and inspection procedures 
 
 
186. Effective complaints and inspection procedures are basic safeguards against ill-treatment in 
prisons. Prisoners should have avenues of complaint open to them, both within and outside the 
prison system, and be entitled to confidential access to an appropriate authority. In addition to 
addressing the individual case involved, the CPT considers that a careful analysis of complaints can 
be a useful tool in identifying issues to be addressed at a general level. 
 
The complaints procedure at SDKK prescribes that prisoners should first attempt to resolve 
any complaint ‘informally’ by addressing prison staff. If this effort fails, the prisoner may receive a 
grievance form and submit this to the Prison Grievance Coordinator, within 20 days of the alleged 
incident. The Coordinator shall assign each request or grievance for investigation and response 
preparation and present a proposed solution/decision to the Director for approval. This should be 
finalised within 20 working days of receiving the complaint.  
  

- 89 - 
189. The Law Enforcement Council (Raad voor de Rechtshandhaving) is an inter-country body 
of Curaçao, St. Maarten and the Netherlands. The Council is charged with the general inspection of 
the effectiveness and quality of several agencies and institutions of the judicial systems of Curaçao, 
Sint Maarten and Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba. The Council also monitors the effectiveness and 
quality of judicial cooperation between Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the Netherlands, in so far as the 
BES-Islands are concerned. While it has a mandate to perform inspections, it does not perform 
regular visits to all places where persons may be deprived of their liberty. Rather, inspections of the 
different institutions under its mandate are carried out on a thematic basis, with priorities decided 
annually. The CPT was informed that an inspection to SDKK had recently been carried out and that 
a report was being drafted. The CPT would like to be provided with a copy of this report. 
 
  

- 91 - 
The delegation was also informed of plans to construct a whole new juvenile detention 
facility at the campus location, envisaging a total of 98 beds, with the creation of a capacity of 24 
places in the initial phase. While welcoming the conceptual approach, the CPT would question the 
need for so many places for juvenile offenders given existing numbers were around 10. Once such a 
facility is built, the temptation will be to fill the whole unit, placing an overemphasis on detention 
of juveniles. This would be in contradiction to one of the cardinal principles enshrined in the United 
98 99
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and in the European Rules for juvenile offenders 
that juveniles should only be deprived of their liberty as a last resort and for the shortest possible 
100
period of time.  
 
 The CPT would appreciate the comments of the Curaçao authorities on this matter.  
 
 
194. At the outset, it should be noted that the delegation did not hear any allegations of physical ill-
treatment by staff at JJIC. Some juveniles, however, did allege verbally aggressive behaviour by 
security staff. 
 
The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities deliver the clear message to staff at 
JJIC that all forms of ill-treatment, including verbal abuse, are not acceptable and will be the 
subject of sanctions. 
 
 
2. Conditions of detention 
 
 
195. Material conditions at the Rembrandtstraat building were not good. The six double-occupancy 
cells (measuring some 20 m² and equipped with a bed and some shelves) were in a poor state of 
repair. The cells had limited access to natural light and poor ventilation and suffered frequent 
sewage and sanitary problems. The cells were sombre and smelly, the flush on the toilet did not 
work, and the mattresses were filthy. The exercise yard was covered, and young persons had no 
view of the sky and limited access to natural light.  
 
 
196. The delegation was particularly concerned by the regime in place at JJIC. Hypothetical 
schedules with activities including education, sports and recreation existed. However, the juveniles 
all complained of the complete lack of purposeful activities, stating they would at most have one 
hour of education per week and one music class. The sports field was not in use, as it was 
considered an escape risk.

(“Riyadh Guidelines”). 

- 93 - 
The CPT recommends that every newly admitted juvenile be properly interviewed and 
physically examined by a medical doctor (or by a fully qualified nurse reporting to a doctor) 
as soon as possible after his or her admission; save for exceptional circumstances, the 
interview and examination should be carried out within 24 hours. 
 
 
5. Other issues 
 
 
200. Possible disciplinary sanctions included confinement to the juvenile’s own cell or to the 
disciplinary cell (number four). The cell measured 8 m² and was equipped with a set of double bunk 
beds. It was dirty and dark, with very limited access to natural light and poor ventilation. The 
maximum placement in the disciplinary cell was three days which, according to the juveniles, was 
not exceptional. This was not an appropriate place to hold juveniles.  
 
 The CPT has very strong reservations as concerns any form of solitary confinement of 
juveniles as this can compromise their physical and/or mental integrity. To this end, it considers that 
a juvenile should never be placed in solitary confinement for disciplinary purposes for a period 
101
exceeding three days, and preferably for period not lasting more than a few hours. 
 
 The delegation further noted a lack of safeguards for the punishment of juveniles, notably 
when they are placed in the isolation cell. There were no procedures in place governing such a 
placement; the measure appeared to be arbitrarily applied and for punitive reasons with no proper 
disciplinary process and no proper recording of the measure in a dedicated register. This is 
unacceptable. 
 
 The delegation was also informed that due to the lack of specialised training for the staff, the 
police were called in on occasion to re-establish order. Such a practice should be ended. 
 
 The CPT recommends that clear guidelines be developed regarding disciplinary 
sanctions, ensuring a minimal resort to the punishment of solitary confinement. Further, 
safeguards should be put in place as well as a recording system which can be used to monitor 
the application of sanctions. 
 
 
201. Had it not been for the fact that a new establishment was close to being opened, with the 
promise of a new regime and approach, the delegation would have recommended the immediate 
closure of the Rembrandtstraat unit. By letter of 24 September 2014, the Curaçao authorities 
confirmed that the new unit became operational on 28 August 2014 and that the facility at the 
Rembrandtstraat is no longer being used for the detention of children. Further, information is 
provided on the increased opportunities for education, work, recreation and outdoor exercise. The 
CPT welcomes this development and would like to receive information on the operation of the 
new unit at the Incastraat, including information on staffing and weekly activities. 
  
                                                 
101 th
  See the 18 General Report on the CPT’s activities – CPT/Inf (2008) 25, paragraph 26. 

- 95 - 
Further, the CPT recommends that the right to inform a person of choice be 
guaranteed and that provision be made that costs of this notification are covered by the State. 
 
In addition, all immigration detainees should be expressly informed of their rights and 
the procedure applicable to them in a language they can understand. They should be 
systematically provided with a document setting out this information; the document should be 
available in the languages most commonly spoken by those concerned and, if necessary, the 
services of an interpreter should be made available. 
 
 
205. The premises consisted of three parts; one for the detention of men, one for women and one 
for staff and administration. The detention block for men comprised a multi-occupancy dormitory 
room (60 m²) with 12 beds and a recreation room, divided by the bathroom. The women’s building 
had a dormitory with 14 beds and a bathroom. The buildings and sanitary facilities were in a good 
state of repair and had sufficient access to natural light and adequate ventilation. The delegation 
found that material conditions had improved considerably since the 2007 visit and could generally 
102
be considered as adequate.  
 
 
206. There was, however, a general lack of purposeful activity in the facility. The male ward had a 
recreation room with a television, dominoes and some fitness equipment but this room was locked 
overnight. The female ward had a television in the dormitory itself. There was a possibility to play 
ball games in the fenced area used for outdoor exercise.  
 
 For short stays of up to three days, which, as noted above, is the case for the vast majority of 
persons held at the Illegalen Barakken, the regime could be considered as acceptable. However, in 
respect of persons who have to stay longer, additional measures need to be taken to offer some 
purposeful activities (educational, recreational or vocational).  
 
 The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities develop a range of purposeful 
activities for detained persons at Illegalen Barakken. The longer the period for which persons 
are detained, the more developed should be the activities which are offered to them. 
 
 
207. The prison staff employed at the facility had not received specific training to deal with the 
particular needs of foreign nationals detained under aliens legislation and played a merely 
supervisory role. It should be noted, however, that the delegation had a positive impression of the 
manager of Illegalen Barakken who appeared to be making a genuine effort to ensure adequate 
103
conditions of detention for all detainees.  
 
 The CPT recommends that staff be selected and trained for the specific purpose of 
104
working with irregular migrants.

clear and more appropriate framework for immigration detention.

E. Klínika Capriles Psychiatric Institution 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
210. Klínika Capriles, located in Willemstad, is the only psychiatric hospital on the island and 
since 2010 exists as a foundation completely independent of the State. The hospital had 199 beds 
spread across a series of recently built units within a large campus area. The majority of patients 
were accommodated in the three Mediumstay units (52 beds), the two Longstay units Esmeralda 
and Margriet (40 beds) and the Klas Florisol (chronic) unit (54 beds). Involuntary patients were 
placed in the 21-bed Pico Plata unit and in the 32-bed Shortstay unit. There was also a day clinic.  
 
 
211. The management of Klínika Capriles intended to remove all fencing from around the clinic 
and, in this respect, acknowledged that the Pico Plata unit was not designed to accommodate 
particularly dangerous forensic psychiatric patients. Indeed, the CPT’s delegation was informed that 
perhaps the FOBA at SDDK would have to transform a section into a proper psychiatric in-patient 
department.  
 
 The CPT considers that persons requiring psychiatric assessment and/or treatment, whatever 
their status, should be assessed and/or treated in a medical facility. At present, the FOBA cannot be 
considered as a medical facility. 
 
 The CPT would like to be informed about the intentions of the Curaçao authorities 
with regard to the placement of forensic psychiatric patients in the future.  
 
 
212. The CPT’s delegation undertook a targeted visit to the closed Pico Plata unit where 
substance abusers and mentally incapacitated offenders were accommodated. At the time of the 
visit, there were 17 patients. It also had an opportunity to tour the whole campus and to visit the 
short-stay admissions unit. 
 
At the outset, the CPT wishes to state that in the units visited, the delegation noted a caring 
and supportive approach by staff towards patients.  
 
 
2. Patients’ living conditions and treatment 
 
 
213. The Pico Plata unit consists of a single-storey L-shaped building looking out onto an 
enclosed courtyard with a high wall. The building was in a state of disrepair and decay with 
problems of damp walls and crumbling ceilings. The three accommodation units each consisted of 
two small dormitories containing three beds, each with its own sanitary annexe (toilet and shower; a 
couple of the showers lacked curtains), and a common kitchen/dining room area between the two 
dormitories. The dormitories were suitably equipped (bed, personal cupboard, bedside table) but 
rather shabby and provided little personal space; it would be preferable that the dormitories 
accommodate no more than two patients each. The units were all clean. The double- and single-
occupancy rooms were in a similar state.  
 

- 99 - 
The seclusion room in Pico Plata was not appropriate for placing patients for extended 
periods and was only used for short time-outs. In each case, the doctor would be informed and the 
measure noted in the individual medical record. If a measure of seclusion was considered necessary 
for a patient from Pico Plata, he would be taken to the recently built admission unit which possessed 
two isolation rooms. Each room was under CCTV and audio surveillance and a nurse visited and 
talked to the patient every 30 minutes. Each patient was provided with rip-proof clothing and a 
blanket. At the end of the period of seclusion, a debriefing would take place. For every instance of 
isolation, the measure was recorded in the patient’s medical file (the time at which the measure 
began and ended; the circumstances of the case; the reasons for resorting to the measure; the name 
of the doctor who ordered or approved it; whether the measure was part of a treatment plan), and a 
central computerised record was also maintained.  
 
The CPT would like to receive a copy of the Klínika Capriles’ policy on restraint, 
including on issues associated with restraint, such as staff training, complaints policy, 
reporting mechanisms and debriefing. 
 
 Further, the CPT would like to receive confirmation that a measure of seclusion is 
always ordered by a doctor and that only in emergency situations is the measure applied by 
nursing staff and a doctor subsequently informed. 
 
 
5. Safeguards 
 
 
a. the initial placement decision and discharge 
 
 
217. The procedure by which involuntary placement is decided should offer guarantees of 
independence and impartiality as well as of objective medical expertise. Leaving aside emergency 
cases, the formal decision to place a person in a psychiatric hospital should always be based on the 
opinion of at least one doctor with psychiatric qualifications, and preferably two, and the actual 
placement decision should be taken by a different body from the one that recommended it. Further, a 
patient must have the right to appeal the measure to a court or mental health tribunal, which should 
see the patient before deciding on the involuntary placement measure if this is possible and not 
detrimental to the person’s health. The patient should also be entitled to legal assistance in such 
proceedings. Where the patient does not appear before the judge, he or she should normally be 
represented by a person acting in his or her interests.  
 
  

- 101 - 
 
b. safeguards during placement 
 
 
219. At the Klínika Capriles, the involuntary admission of a patient was considered to provide the 
authorisation to administer compulsory treatment.  
 
The CPT has fundamental objections to such an approach. The Committee considers that 
patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed 
consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis 
should not be construed as authorising treatment without his or her consent. It follows that every 
patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any 
other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law 
and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances. 
Of course, consent to treatment can only be qualified as free and informed if it is based on full, 
accurate and comprehensible information about the patient's condition and the treatment proposed. 
Consequently, all patients should be provided systematically with relevant information about their 
condition and the treatment which it is proposed to prescribe for them. Relevant information (results, 
etc.) should also be provided following treatment. 
 
The CPT recommends that the Curaçao authorities take the necessary steps to recognise 
the principle of free and informed consent to treatment, in the light of the above remarks.  
 
 
220. All patients were provided with a Patient’s Rights Brochure upon admission to Klínika 
Capriles. The policy of the hospital was to move away from ward rules to a focus on the rights of 
patients. The brochure provided, for example, the following rights: 
 The right to quality treatment and care, respecting personal dignity and right to self 
determination. 
 The right to a treatment plan, prepared by the caregiver to the extent possible together with 
the patient, immediately after admission. 
 The right to information and participation in the preparation of the treatment plan. 
 The right to a file and access to the file. To the extent permitted by law, the patient has the 
right to demand that the file or parts of the file be destroyed. 
 The right to confidentiality. In case of involuntary admission, information is provided to the 
legal representative. 
 The rights in case of measures. Specific measures should end as soon as the danger has 
passed. In cases which occur more or less regularly, the measures to be applied will be 
specified in the treatment plan. The measures are: isolation (locked regular room), 
separation (special room), fixation to seat or bed, medication, administration of food and 
liquids. 
 The right to move freely. In case of involuntary admission, this is limited to the hospital 
premises. 
 The right to contact with the outside world. 
 The right to discuss the case with the patient counsellor who may assist in defending the 
patient’s rights. 
 
Patients met by the delegation had been advised of their rights in a language they could 
understand. The CPT endorses such a rights-based approach towards patients.

SINT MAARTEN 
 
 
A. Police 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
223. Further to the recent constitutional changes of 2010, criminal legislation on Sint Maarten is 
in a period of transition. A new criminal code was adopted in December 2012 and a draft Caribbean 
Criminal Procedure Code was presented to the respective Ministers of Justice of Aruba, Curaçao, 
Sint Maarten and the Netherlands in November 2013 and is pending adoption. Once adopted, this 
Code should apply on all islands of the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In the 
meantime, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) in force on Sint Maarten remains the old 
107
Netherlands Antilles CCP of 1996. The legal framework governing the detention of criminal 
suspects by the police has therefore basically remained unchanged since the CPT's 2002 visit.  
 
In short, persons suspected of having committed a criminal offence may be held by the 
108
police for questioning for a maximum of six hours. Thereafter, if the needs of the investigation so 
require, the person may be placed in police custody for a maximum period of two days 
109
(inverzekeringstelling), on the decision of a prosecutor or of an assistant prosecutor reporting to 
110
the prosecutor in writing or orally as soon as possible and within 24 hours. Police custody may be 
111
further extended by the prosecutor for an additional maximum period of eight days. However, the 
suspect must be brought before the investigating judge as soon as possible - and within 24 hours - 
112
after the beginning of such an extension in order to decide on its lawfulness. Thus the legal 
maximum period before a person deprived of his/her liberty is brought before a judge amounts to 
three days and 16 hours.  
 
Thereafter, a person may be placed in remand detention (voorlopige hechtenis) as regulated 
in Title VIII of the CCP. A maximum of eight days of custody (bewaring) may be ordered by the 
113
investigating judge, renewable once. This detention, however, as well as any further remand 
114
custody (gevangenhouding en gevangenneming), should take place at a remand facility under the 
115
responsibility of the head of that facility; that is, at Point Blanche Prison. 
 
The CPT considers that a person should be kept in police custody for the shortest amount of 
time possible, preferably less than 24 hours. To this end, it recommends that the Sint Maarten 
authorities amend the draft CCP accordingly.

- 105 - 
The CPT recommends that the Sint Maarten authorities ensure that all persons 
deprived of their liberty by the police, for whatever reason, are granted the right to notify a 
close relative or third party of their choice about their situation as from the very outset of their 
deprivation of liberty. The exercise of this right could be made subject to certain exceptions 
designed to protect the legitimate interests of the police investigation, provided those exceptions 
are clearly circumscribed in law and made subject to appropriate safeguards (e.g. any delay in 
notification of custody to be recorded in writing with the specific reasons therefor and to 
require the approval of a senior police officer unconnected with the case at hand or a public 
prosecutor). 
 
 
228. Article 48 of the CCP provides for the right of access to a lawyer for persons apprehended 
by the police. Further, following the Salduz judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 27 
116
November 2008 and a judgment of the Supreme Court based upon it, the Public Prosecution 
Service announced a new policy on the presence of a lawyer during interviews. Consequently, all 
persons apprehended must be now informed by an investigating officer, prior to the first interview, 
of his or her right to consult a lawyer before the interview. The lawyer of the suspect’s choice – or 
otherwise the duty lawyer – must be telephoned either by the reporting officer who arrested the 
suspect or by the assistant public prosecutor before whom the suspect was brought after his arrest. 
This is a positive development. 
 
 However, it would appear that in numerous cases detained persons were presented with a 
waiver form to sign declaring that they did not wish to have access to a lawyer before the first 
police interview. Persons met by the delegation stated that they were unsure what they were signing 
and many thought it was the form about their right to a lawyer. Indeed, many persons had only been 
able to contact a lawyer once they were taken before a judge concerning the extension of their 
detention period (i.e. after two days).  
 
 The delegation also met two juveniles who stated that they had not had a lawyer or person of 
trust present when they had been interviewed for the first time by the police. 
 
 One reason presented to the CPT for the delay in access to a lawyer was that legal aid for 
detained persons was only applicable from the moment that persons were brought before a judge to 
have their detention extended (i.e. after two to three days). This deficiency should be remedied. 
 
 The CPT recommends that the Sint Maarten authorities take the necessary steps to 
ensure that all persons are afforded the right of access to a lawyer in practice as from the 
outset of their deprivation of liberty. Such a right should include access to an ex officio lawyer 
if required.  
 
 
  
                                                 
116
  Judgment of 30 June 2009; reference LJN: BH3079. 

- 107 - 
231. The conditions of detention were extremely poor. The cell area was dark and dank; cells had 
little access to natural light and the artificial lighting in the corridors was insufficient for reading 
purposes; there was inadequate ventilation and many of the sanitary annexes in the cells emitted a 
foul smell. In several cells, there was leakage from the sanitary annexes, which were not fully 
partitioned from the rest of the cell. In the larger cells (16 m²) there were two sets of bunk beds for 
four persons but it was quite usual for an additional two or three persons to be kept overnight in 
these cells, sleeping on a mattress on the floor. Many of the mattresses were dirty and worn, or 
consisted of broken pieces of foam held together by a sheet. Moreover, during the first 10 days of 
detention (the period considered as police custody) staff confirmed that detained persons were not 
provided with sheets, a pillow or a towel. A number of persons displayed rashes all over their 
bodies. There were also no call bells in the cells which meant that detained persons had to shout 
repeatedly to attract the attention of staff, often resulting in terse exchanges. 
 
 The situation was exacerbated by the fact that there was no regime in place. Sentenced 
inmates were offered two periods of up to one hour each in a courtyard and those in police custody 
up to one hour. There were no other activities and no access to television or radio. 
 
 Some people had been held in these conditions for several months. 
 
 The CPT recommends that urgent steps be taken to improve the conditions of 
detention at Philipsburg Police Station, in particular: 
 all detained persons should be provided with at least 4 m² of living space per person in 
multi-occupancy cells; 
 all detained persons should be provided with their own bed; 
 all detained persons should be provided with a sheet, pillow and towel from the 
moment they are accommodated in this facility, as well as with hygiene products and 
cleaning materials for the cell; 
 ventilation and access to natural light should be improved; 
 all sanitary annexes should be partitioned up to the ceiling and leaking toilets and 
pipes repaired; 
 all cells should be equipped with a call bell. 
 
Moreover, the CPT recommends that persons should not be detained at Philipsburg 
Police Station in excess of three days and in any event never longer than 10 days. The facility 
is totally inappropriate for holding remand and sentenced prisoners, and the CPT 
recommends that they be moved to alternative accommodation as soon as possible. 
 
 
5. Juveniles in detention 
 
 
232. At the time of the visit, three juveniles were being held in two cells at Philipsburg Police 
Station. One juvenile had spent 56 days in a cell on his own and another some 20 days before the 
third juvenile had arrived a few days prior to the visit. They were provided with maths and English 
classes each morning, although the teacher did not always turn up, and were offered outdoor 
exercise twice a day. They were also brought to the gym at Point Blanche once a week, although 
they found this rather uncomfortable as the older prisoners tried to supply them with marihuana. 
Otherwise, they were confined to their cells for 20 hours a day.  
 
 

- 109 - 
B. Point Blanche Prison 
 
 
1. Preliminary remarks 
 
 
234. Point Blanche Prison, accessible only by an extremely steep and narrow concrete road, is 
located on a secluded hilltop in the outskirts of Philipsburg. The prison, built in the 1990s, is 
designed on the Panopticon model, although there was a disjuncture between the central observation 
room and the four accommodation wings (eight spurs) which meant that staff could not properly see 
117
what prisoners were doing. There was a separate small unit for female prisoners. 
 
The prison had a capacity of 134 places: 120 for male and 14 for female prisoners. However, 
at the time of the visit, the establishment was in the process of undergoing extensive renovations 
which meant that the female section was closed and the eight spurs of the male accommodation 
block were being upgraded one at a time. As a consequence, the prison was holding 110 male 
prisoners. However, an additional 58 prisoners (including 11 women and three juveniles) were 
being held at Philipsburg Police Station and at Simpson Bay Remand Centre, both of which were 
staffed by prison officers and under the operational management of Point Blanche Prison. 
 
All categories of male and female prisoners were held in the prison: convicted prisoners 
serving long and short sentences, remand prisoners and young offenders. 
 
 
235. In the course of the visit, the delegation was appraised of plans to build two additional floors 
on top of the existing accommodation block. The first additional floor would contain 40 cells (i.e. 
an exact replica of the existing accommodation spurs) and the upper floor two wings with 20 cells 
for young people and two wings with rooms for activities. This would increase the capacity of the 
prison by a further 180 places, creating a prison with an overall capacity of 314 places. 
 
 The CPT acknowledges that the current capacity of the prison is already too small for the 
number of prisoners and that the small footprint of the establishment means that there are few 
options to increase the capacity other than through building additional floors. Nevertheless, the 
Committee wishes to highlight several concerns regarding the proposed expansion of the prison. 
 
 
236. The prison population in Sint Maarten has risen from 131 in 2002 to 168 in 2014 at the time 
of the visit, an increase of some 30%, which brings the rate of imprisonment for the territory to the 
118
equivalent of 420 per 100,000. Should the additional capacity at Pointe Blanche Prison be 
brought into service, experience shows that it is likely to be filled which means that the rate of 
imprisonment could reach levels of over 750 per 100,000, resulting in Sint Maarten having one of 
the highest rates of incarceration in the world. The Committee considers that it would be far 
preferable for a strategy for the sustainable reduction of the prison population to be put in place, 
which ensures that imprisonment is in practice the measure of last resort at all stages of the criminal 
justice system, from pre-trial to the execution of sentences. In the light of experience in certain 
other jurisdictions, consideration might also be given to avoiding sending persons to prison for short 
periods. Instead, such sentences could be served in the community. The report of the Council on 
Law Enforcement on “Detention capacity in St Maarten” submitted to the Minister of Justice on 26 
February 2014 would appear to advocate a similar approach. 
                                                 
117
  The Aruban Correctional Institution (KIA) has exactly the same design, with the staff control room situated 
between the ground and first floor. 
118
  In Aruba the rate is 210 per 100,000 and in Curaçao closer to 200 per 100,000.  

- 111 - 
239. Many prisoners told the CPT’s delegation that they did not feel safe in Point Blanche Prison 
and several allegations of inter-prisoner violence and intimidation were received. In particular, 
some inmates stated that prison officers were either not aware or insufficiently attentive to the 
possibility of prisoners from one wing being able to mix with other prisoners from another wing 
when the gates leading on to the central gallery were opened. Moreover, a few inmates alleged that 
119
staff were slow to intervene when a fight among inmates broke out. In addition, a few inmates 
stated that no action was taken by the prison authorities when they made complaints about prisoners 
threatening and intimidating them, and that in the past prisoners were not punished for assaulting 
another inmate. 
 
 In the period since the delegation’s visit, the CPT was informed about a serious violent 
incident in Point Blanche Prison on 11 September 2014, involving a firearm and machetes. In the 
subsequent search of the establishment another firearm and several stabbing weapons were found. 
The incident has apparently led to action being taken, including a plan to set up a task force to 
restructure the prison. Further, the delegation received information that on 1 October 2014 an 
inmate had been stabbed at Simpson Bay Remand Centre.  
 
 
240. Addressing the phenomenon of inter-prisoner violence and intimidation requires that prison 
staff be alert to signs of trouble and both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary. 
The existence of positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of dynamic 
security and care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff 
being present and possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. It is also obvious that 
an effective strategy to tackle inter-prisoner intimidation/violence should seek to ensure that prison 
staff are placed in a position to exercise their authority in an appropriate manner. Consequently, the 
level of staffing must be sufficient (including at night-time) to enable prison officers to supervise 
adequately the activities of prisoners and support each other effectively in the exercise of their 
tasks. Both initial and ongoing training programmes for staff of all grades must address the issue of 
managing inter-prisoner violence. 
 
 In addition, a key component in the management of inter-prisoner relations is the careful 
assessment, classification and cell allocation of individual prisoners within the prison population.  
 
 The CPT reiterates its recommendation that the prison management of Point Blanche 
Prison develop a strategy to address the challenge of inter-prisoner violence, taking into 
account the above remarks. Further, it wishes to receive information on the investigations into 
the incidents mentioned in paragraph 239 and any subsequent action taken.

  However, the action of a prison officer who placed his body between two prisoners in November 2013, one of 
whom was slashing the other prisoner with a home-made machete, represents a singular act of self-sacrifice 
and professionalism.

243. At the time of the visit, there was little in the way of purposeful activities for prisoners, with 
only some 20 prisoners having work while the vast majority of prisoners idled away their days. 
 
The CPT recalls that the aim should be to ensure that all prisoners, including those on 
remand, spend a reasonable part of the day (i.e. eight hours or more) outside their cells, engaged in 
purposeful activities of a varied nature: work, preferably with vocational value; education; sport; 
recreation/association. A regime which provides for varied activities, as part of an individualised 
sentence plan, is essential for the welfare of prisoners during their incarceration as well as being a 
vital component in the preparation for release. 
 
The CPT reiterates its recommendation that activities for prisoners be further 
developed, with a view to ensuring that all prisoners (including those on remand) can spend a 
reasonable part of the day (i.e. 8 hours or more) outside their cells engaged in purposeful 
activities of a varied nature: work, preferably with vocational value; education; sport; 
recreation/association. 
 
 
b. Simpson Bay Remand Centre 
 
 
244. Simpson Bay was built as an immigration detention centre and a Judicial Permission of 25 
November 2011 and signed by the Minister of Justice was granted to allow the premises to be used 
as a prison for 18 months.  
 
At the time of the visit, all 11 female remand and sentenced prisoners were being held in a 
large dormitory on the first floor. The room was in a decent state of repair and had reasonable 
access to natural light and adequate artificial lighting. However, there was little ventilation and the 
toilets, lined up in a row, provided no privacy as there was no door enclosing each cubicle. 
 
As for the regime, the women had access to an association room from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
where they could watch television, and an effort had been made to initiate a series of activities such 
as anger management, Bible and English language classes for two and a half hours twice a week. 
Moreover, the women were not offered any outdoor exercise. Taken together this does not 
constitute a sufficient programme of purpose activities. 
 
The conditions of detention in the two dormitories on the second floor, which were 
accommodating male prisoners, were of a similar standard. Although they were offered access to an 
outdoor exercise yard every day, they were not provided with any activities. 
 
While bearing in mind that holding prisoners at Simpson Bay is supposed to be a temporary 
measure (up to some four months at the time of the visit), it is nevertheless important that prisoners 
are provided with decent material conditions and that they are offered some purposeful activities. 
Further, they should all be offered at least one hour of outdoor exercise every day. 
 
The CPT recommends that the necessary steps be taken to remedy the deficiencies 
outlined above, for as long as Simpson Bay continues to be used for holding prisoners.

5. Health-care services 
 
 
247. At the time of the visit, a general practitioner visited the prison once a week for four hours 
and there were three full-time nurses, all of whom were present in the establishment from 7.30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. five days a week. Outside of these hours and at weekends, a nurse was on call. In addition, 
a psychiatrist visited every fortnight. Specialist consultations were arranged with the hospital in 
Philipsburg and posed no specific difficulties. However, there was no visiting dentist and the 
waiting list for an outside consultation was many months. 
For a prison with an actual population of over 160 inmates, in three locations, the number of 
visiting hours of the doctor was too low.  
 
The CPT recommends that the presence of the doctor at the prison be increased to the 
equivalent of a half-time position. Further, provision should be made for a dentist to visit the 
prison once a week and for the dentist’s surgery to be properly equipped. 
 
 
248. The CPT’s delegation noted favourably that every newly admitted prisoner to Point Blanche 
was seen by a nurse within 24 hours of arrival. The medical assessment included screening for 
infectious diseases (including HIV and hepatitis C), mental health problems and addictions; blood 
samples were sent to an outside laboratory. The written consent of the prisoners was obligatory 
before any blood samples were taken. 
 
 
249. The CPT has consistently pointed out that prison health-care services can make a significant 
contribution to the prevention of ill-treatment of detained persons through, inter alia, the systematic 
recording of injuries, whether vis-à-vis new arrivals or following a violent episode in prison. In this 
respect, the health-care services at Point Blanche Prison generally recorded injuries observed in 
sufficient detail. However, in addition to a description of any injuries, the doctor should note down 
a full account of the statements made by the person concerned which are relevant to the medical 
examination. Further, a doctor should indicate as far as possible the consistency between any 
allegations made and the objective medical findings; this will enable the relevant authorities to 
properly assess the information set out in the record. Such an approach was not being followed at 
Pointe Blanche. In addition, it is essential that all such reports are transmitted to the relevant 
authorities. 
 
The CPT recommends that measures be taken to ensure that the record drawn up 
after the medical examination of a prisoner – whether newly arrived or following a violent 
incident in prison – contains:  
 
(i) an account of statements made by the person which are relevant to the medical 
examination (including his/her description of his/her state of health and any allegations 
of ill-treatment);  
(ii) a full account of objective medical findings based on a thorough examination;  
(iii) the doctor’s observations in the light of i) and ii) indicating the consistency 
between any allegations made and the objective medical findings.  
  

- 117 - 
The CPT acknowledges the challenge facing the authorities of having to establish an 
institution which would be capable of providing the different types of specialist care required based 
on treatment and rehabilitation, for the rather small numbers of patients involved. 
 
The CPT recommends that the Sint Maarten authorities take the necessary steps to 
ensure that prisoners suffering from a serious mental disorder are cared for in an adequately 
equipped hospital environment. Further, it would like to receive details of the treatment 
afforded to the above-mentioned prisoner since the time of the visit. 
 
 
6. Other issues  
 
 
252. As regards discipline, the CPT’s delegation noted that there had been 55 cases in the 13 
months prior to the visit. Due to the lack of space, recourse to solitary confinement was rare and 
most punishments consisted of a denial of visits or of bringing in food from outside.  
 
 It was, however, difficult to obtain a clear overall picture in relation to discipline and the use 
of force due to the way in which the records were kept. It is envisaged that the new computer 
system will enable better record keeping and the possibility to extract the information in a way that 
is useful for management and oversight purposes. The CPT would like to receive confirmation 
that a new record keeping procedure for disciplinary offences and use of force is now in place. 
 
 
253. A number of prisoners complained about the manner in which cell searches were carried out 
by a special unit of officers wearing balaclavas and accompanied by dogs. They stated that during 
the last search in December 2013, the officers had thrown all the belongings in the cell onto the 
floor and trampled over them, breaking several personal possessions and dirtying clothes and 
bedding.  
 
 The CPT wishes to emphasise that it is opposed to the wearing of balaclavas by special-
purpose units carrying out operations within penitentiary establishments. The Committee recognises 
that, for operational and/or security reasons, the wearing of protective helmets may be necessary. 
However, it should be ensured that subsequent identification of the officers concerned is always 
possible by the relevant authorities and by prisoners, through not only a clearly distinctive badge 
but also a prominent identification number on each uniform/helmet. In addition, interventions of 
this type should be video recorded (e.g. with tactical cameras as part of the equipment of the 
penitentiary officers concerned). A prisoner from the cell being searched or an independent 
observer should be present to ensure the search is carried out correctly. 
 
 The CPT recommends that a clear protocol for cell searches be drawn up, taking into 
account the above remarks. 
 
  

- 119 - 
257. There was once again considerable confusion among the prisoners concerning the 
calculation of their respective release dates. Many inmates said that they did not know whether they 
had to serve two-thirds or four-fifths of the sentence, and several alleged that the initial date 
provided to them was changed when they approached it. This is surprising since the current 
Criminal Code of Sint Maarten clearly states in Article 131 that conditional release may be granted 
after two-thirds of sentences exceeding one year and that police detention and remand count 
towards this period. Further, Article 135(2) of the Criminal Code states that conditional release may 
be postponed to a later date or not be granted at all, upon the advice of the parole board. It is 
essential that prisoners be clearly informed of the date at which point they will become eligible for 
conditional release and that the procedures for keeping a person in prison beyond this date are 
transparent and any decision taken reasoned and reviewable, with a copy provided to the prisoner.  
 
 The CPT recommends that all prisoners be accurately informed of their release date 
120
from prison as soon as possible after their admission to prison, in light of the above 
remarks. 
 
 Further, in light of the decision of the Constitutional Court of Sint Maarten of 
8 November 2013, in which it held that limiting the possibility of early conditional release to 
nationals and residents of Sint Maarten was unfair, the CPT would like to be informed whether 
any foreign nationals have been granted conditional release and, if so, under what terms.
