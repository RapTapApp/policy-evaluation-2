PEER REVIEWS, COMBINED: PHASE 1 + PHASE 2
THE NETHERLANDS
The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is the 
Peer Review Report
multilateral framework within which work in the area of tax transparency and exchange of 
information is carried out by over 100 jurisdictions which participate in the work of the Global 
Combined: Phase 1 + Phase 2
Forum on an equal footing. 
The Global Forum is charged with in-depth monitoring and peer review of the implementation 
of the standards of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. These 
standards are primarily reﬂ ected in the 2002 OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of 
Information on Tax Matters and its commentary, and in Article 26 of the OECD Model Tax 
Convention on Income and on Capital and its commentary as updated in 2004, which has 
THE NETHERLANDS
been incorporated in the UN Model Tax Convention.  
The standards provide for international exchange on request of foreseeably relevant 
information for the administration or enforcement of the domestic tax laws of a requesting 
party. “Fishing expeditions” are not authorised, but all foreseeably relevant information must 
be provided, including bank information and information held by ﬁ duciaries, regardless of the 
existence of a domestic tax interest or the application of a dual criminality standard.
All members of the Global Forum, as well as jurisdictions identiﬁ ed by the Global Forum as 
relevant to its work, are being reviewed. This process is undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 
reviews assess the quality of a jurisdiction’s legal and regulatory framework for the exchange 
of information, while Phase 2 reviews look at the practical implementation of that framework.  
Some Global Forum members are undergoing combined – Phase 1 plus Phase 2 – reviews. 
The ultimate goal is to help jurisdictions to effectively implement the international standards 
of transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes. 
All review reports are published once approved by the Global Forum and they thus represent 
agreed Global Forum reports.

ABOUT THE GLOBAL FORUM – 5
About the Global Forum
The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax 
Purposes is the multilateral framework within which work in the area of tax 
transparency and exchange of information is carried out by over 100 jurisdic-
tions which participate in the Global Forum on an equal footing.
The Global Forum is charged with in-depth monitoring and peer review 
of the implementation of the international standards of transparency and 
exchange of information for tax purposes. These standards are primarily 
reflected in the 2002 OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information 
on Tax Matters and its commentary, and in Article 26 of the OECD Model 
Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and its commentary as updated in 
2004, which has been incorporated in the UN Model Tax Convention.
The standards provide for international exchange on request of foresee-
ably relevant information for the administration or enforcement of the domes-
tic tax laws of a requesting party. Fishing expeditions are not authorised but 
all foreseeably relevant information must be provided, including bank infor-
mation and information held by fiduciaries, regardless of the existence of a 
domestic tax interest or the application of a dual criminality standard.
All members of the Global Forum, as well as jurisdictions identified by 
the Global Forum as relevant to its work, are being reviewed. This process is 
undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 reviews assess the quality of jurisdictions’ 
legal and regulatory framework for the exchange of information, while Phase 2 
reviews look at the practical implementation of that framework. Some Global 
Forum members are undergoing combined – Phase 1 plus Phase 2 – reviews.
The Global Forum has also put in place a process for supplementary reports 
to follow-up on recommendations, as well as for the ongoing monitoring of 
jurisdictions following the conclusion of a review. The ultimate goal is to help 
jurisdictions to effectively implement the international standards of transpar-
ency and exchange of information for tax purposes.
All review reports are published once approved by the Global Forum and 
they thus represent agreed Global Forum reports. For more information on 
the work of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information 
for Tax Purposes, and for copies of the published review reports, please refer

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY – 7
Executive Summary
1. This report summarises the legal and regulatory framework for transpar-
ency and exchange of information in the Netherlands as well as practical imple-
mentation of that framework. The international standard which is set out in the 
Global Forum’s Terms of Reference to Monitor and Review Progress Towards 
Transparency and Exchange of Information, is concerned with the availability 
of relevant information within a jurisdiction, the competent authority’s ability to 
gain timely access to that information, and in turn, whether that information can 
be effectively exchanged with its exchange of information partners.
1
2. The Netherlands has a relatively small domestic and large foreign 
market, and has thus historically focussed on removing obstacles to the 
international flow of goods, capital and services. Starting with its first 
agreement that provided for sharing of information with Belgium in 1845, 
the Netherlands now has an extensive network of 86 taxation treaties, cover-
ing 90 jurisdictions, and 28 taxation information exchange agreements, the 
majority of which provide for international exchange of information for tax 
purposes in line with the international standard. In addition, the Netherlands 
is able to exchange information with other European Member States under 
various EU mechanisms that provide for exchange of information on auto-
matic and spontaneous bases in addition to information exchange on request.
3. The 22 agreements signed by the Netherlands Antilles are almost all 
in line with the international standard and continue to apply to the Caribbean 
part of the Netherlands. Under the BES Taxation Act, the Netherlands will 
provide information to its treaty partners in respect of these islands also.
There has not yet been any international exchange of information in tax mat-
ters concerning the Caribbean part of the Netherlands and thus it is too early 
to determine the effectiveness of this system in practice. The Global Forum 
will further consider practical aspects of the exchange of information relating 
1. This review relates to the Netherlands and its three special municipalities in the 
Caribbean (Bonnaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba). The other countries which are 
members of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten) 
are independent members of the Global Forum and are reviewed separately.

Introduction
Information and methodology used for the peer review of the 
Netherlands
10. The assessment of the legal and regulatory framework of the 
Netherlands and the practical implementation and effectiveness of this frame-
work was based on the international standards for transparency and exchange 
of information as described in the Global Forum’s Terms of Reference to 
Monitor and Review Progress Towards Transparency and Exchange of 
Information, and was prepared using the Global Forum’s Methodology for 
Peer Reviews and Non-Member Reviews. The assessment was based on the 
laws, regulations, and exchange of information mechanisms in force or effect 
as at July 2011, other information, explanations and materials supplied by 
the Netherlands during the on-site visit that took place on 9-13 May 2011, 
and information supplied by partner jurisdictions. During the on-site visit, 
the assessment team met with officials and representatives of the relevant 
Netherlands agencies including the Ministry of Finance, the Chamber of 
Commerce and the Authority for Financial Markets.
11. The Terms of Reference breaks down the standards of transparency 
and exchange of information into 10 essential elements and 31 enumerated 
aspects under three broad categories: (A) availability of information; (B)
access to information; and (C) exchanging information. This combined 
review assesses the Netherlands’s legal and regulatory framework and the 
implementation and effectiveness of this framework against these elements 
and each of the enumerated aspects. In respect of each essential element 
a determination is made regarding the Netherlands’s legal and regulatory 
framework that either: (i) the element is in place; (ii) the element is in place 
but certain aspects of the legal implementation of the element need improve-
ment; or (iii) the element is not in place. These determinations are accompa-
nied by recommendations for improvement where relevant. In addition, to 
reflect the Phase 2 component, recommendations are also made concerning 
the Netherlands’s practical application of each of the essential elements.
As outlined in the Note on Assessment Criteria, following a jurisdiction’s

vast majority of the inhabitants. Another official language is Frisian (Frysk), 
which is spoken in the northern province of Friesland (Fryslân).
15. The Caribbean Netherlands comprises Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and 
Saba, which have a collective population of 18 000 inhabitants and an area 
2
of 322 km . Netherlands and English are the official languages of Saba and 
Saint Eustatius, while Netherlands and Papiamentu are the official languages 
of Bonaire. The Netherlands currency is the Euro. From 1 January 2011, the 
4
official currency of the Caribbean Netherlands is the US Dollar.

16. The Netherlands has an open economy. With a GDP of USD 680.4 bil-
nd
lion in 2010, it is the 22 largest economy in the word. The service sectors con-
tribute about 72% to its GDP, whereas industry (24.9%) and agriculture (2.6%) 
th
make up most of the remaining. The Netherlands is the 9 largest exporter 
in the world with total exports valued at EUR 309.3 billion in 2009. Exports 
of machinery and equipment, chemicals and fuel are mainly to Germany, 
Belgium, France and the UK. The imports, amounting to EUR 274 billion in 
2009, are mainly from Germany, China, Belgium and the USA. Germany is by 
far the most important trading partner for the Netherlands.
17. Tourism is the mainstay of the economies of the Caribbean 
6
Netherlands . The Caribbean Netherlands has close trading relations with 
Venezuela and other countries in the region. Almost all capital and consumer 
goods are imported.
18. The Netherlands is a founding member of the European Union 
(EU), and is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It joined 
the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax 
Purposes in 2009. The Caribbean Netherlands is not part of the EU and 
instead constitute “overseas countries and territories” of the union to which 
7
special provisions apply.

European territory of Denmark, France or the Netherlands regarding the applica-
tion of EU treaties to the territory. The position of the islands will be reviewed

instance). Each District Court is made up of a maximum of five sectors, 
which include at least administrative (including tax cases), civil and criminal 
law. Appeals from the District Courts are decided by the competent Court of 
Appeal. In addition to criminal and civil cases, the Court of Appeal decides 
appeals against tax assessments, in its capacity as an administrative court.
Court of Appeal Decisions can be contested in the Supreme Court of the 
Netherlands on points of law.
23. The Caribbean Netherlands (CN) has a legal system, different 
from the European part of the Netherlands, which is largely derived from 
the law of former Netherlands Antilles. The legal system of the Caribbean 
Netherlands is based on civil law and relies on a single national law. With the 
exception of matters at the discretion of the Islands authorities, all laws are 
made in the Netherlands and have the same hierarchy as in the Netherlands.
24. The islands of the Caribbean Netherlands are classed in Netherlands 
law as being openbare lichamen (literally translated as “public bodies”) 
and not gemeenten (municipalities). They do not form part of a Netherlands 
province, and the powers normally exercised by provincial councils within 
municipalities are divided between the island governments themselves and 
the central government (by means of the National Office for the Caribbean 
Netherlands). Executive power rests with the governing council (bestuurscol-
lege) headed by a Lieutenant Governor (gezaghebber). The main democratic 
body for each public body is the Island Council (eilandsraad).
25. A large number of laws of the Caribbean Netherlands have been 
enacted since 10 October 2010. The National Office for the Caribbean 
Netherlands (Rijksdienst Caribisch Nederland) has assumed responsibility for 
taxation, policing, immigration, transport, infrastructure, health, education 
and social security in the islands and provides these services on behalf of the 
Government of the Netherlands.
Tax system
26. The Netherlands levies income tax, corporate income tax, wage tax, 
dividend tax, VAT, inheritance tax and gift tax as the important national 
taxes. Article 104 of the Constitution provides that state taxes can only be 
levied on the basis of a law.
27. Individuals resident in the Netherlands are subject to income tax on 
their worldwide income. Non-resident individuals are subject to income tax 
on income from sources in the Netherlands. The tax year follows the calen-
dar year. Income is classified into three boxes: income from employment 
and home ownership (progressive tax rate, maximum 52%); income from a 
substantial interest (flat tax rate, 25%); and, income from savings and invest-
ments (flat tax rate, 30%).

1January 2011. The substantive tax law in the Caribbean Netherlands dif-
fers from that of the Netherlands, but the procedural law is quite similar.
Overview of the financial sector and relevant professions
32. The Netherlands has a modern and developed financial sector which 
contributes 6 to 7% to GDP. Financial services regulation is structured 
according to the “Twin Peaks” model. The Central Bank (De Nederlandsche 
Bank; DNB) focuses on prudential supervision of financial enterprises and 
on admission of financial enterprises to the financial markets, while the 
Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten; AFM)
focuses on supervision of conduct of the financial markets. Integrity and 
AML/CFT supervision are performed by both. The institutions under the pur-
view of the DNB are: banks, insurance companies, pension funds, bureaux 
de change, and money transfer offices. The AFM supervises approximately 
14 000 financial institutions; the majority of which (approximately 10 000) 
are financial service providers. The DNB and AFM also supervise the finan-
cial sector in the Caribbean Netherlands.
33. The banking sector comprises 103 banks, 58 of which are incorpo-
rated in the Netherlands and banks that are part of financial conglomerates.
At the end of the first quarter of 2011, assets in the banking sector amounted 
to EUR 2 703 193 million. The four largest banks (ABN Amro Bank, ING
Bank, Rabo bank, and SNS Reaal) account for about 80% of the Netherlands’ 
banking market. As of July 2011, 12 money transaction offices (including 
money transfer offices and bureaux de change) are registered with and super-
vised by the DNB.
34. Insurance companies in the Netherlands perform a number of func-
tions, including making loans, granting mortgages and purchasing real estate.
In early 2011 the insurance sector was composed of 322 insurers (46 life 
insurers, 29 benefits-in-kind and funeral expenses insurers, and 247 non-life 
insurers).
35. The Netherlands has a large, well developed asset management 
sector comprised of pension and investment funds. At the end of the first 
quarter of 2011 investment funds (excluding pension funds and insurers) had 
assets under management totalling EUR 493 billion. The Amsterdam Stock

providers are obliged entities to undertake customer due diligence measures 
in respect of their customers.
Recent developments
42. Effective 1 January 2011, changes made to the exchange of informa-
tion regime of the Caribbean Netherlands bring it in line with the Netherlands 
International Assistance (Levying of Taxes) Act. Requests for information 
will now be responded to 10 days after notification is given to the person 
from whom information is gathered (previously this period was two months).
43. A new Mutual Assistance Directive was adopted by the European 
Council on 15 February 2011 and will come into force on 1 January 2013.
44. As of July 2011 a new system of supervision of legal persons has 
come into force. Relevant data is collected by a special department of the 
Ministry of Security and Justice, e.g. from the Commercial Register, the 
Civil Register and the Insolvency Register. When there is an increased risk 
of misuse, a report is sent to the relevant authorities who may decide to start 
an investigation.
45. Also, a bill is under preparation that will require foundations to 
deposit accounting records with the Chamber of Commerce.
46. A dematerialisation process for bearer shares is currently being 
developed and a central depository is being set up to collect bearer shares.
The Netherlands RIS List has been created, containing a summary of all the 
reports drawn up by the police with regard to stolen or missing bearer securi-
ties. The objective of this RIS List is to administer centrally the registration 
of stolen or lost physical bearer securities.
plans to integrate these laws into a single BES Money Laundering and Terrorist 
Financing Prevention Act.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS: AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION – 19
Compliance with the Standards
A. Availability of information
Overview
47. Effective exchange of information requires the availability of reliable 
information. In particular, it requires information on the identity of owners 
and other stakeholders as well as information on the transactions carried out 
by entities and other organisational structures. Such information may be kept 
for tax, regulatory, commercial or other reasons. If the information is not 
kept or it is not maintained for a reasonable period of time, a jurisdiction’s 
competent authority may not be able to obtain and provide it when requested.
This section of the report describes and assesses the Netherlands’s legal and 
regulatory framework on availability of information. It also assesses the 
implementation and effectiveness of this framework.
48. The legal and regulatory framework for the maintenance of own-
ership and identity information is in place in the Netherlands for many 
relevant entities, with some exceptions related to limited partnerships and 
foundations.
49. Information on the owners of companies is available to the 
Netherlands authorities through a variety of mechanisms. All companies 
incorporated under the Netherlands’ law, or foreign companies carrying on 
business in the Netherlands must register with the Chamber of Commerce 
and after registration the identity information of companies is available. Both 
private and public limited liability companies are required to keep the share-
holders register, which must be updated regularly. And resident companies

where bearer shares are issued or with respect to limited partners in limited 
partnerships and some beneficiaries of foundations.
56. In practice, identity and ownership information needed by inter-
national partners appears to be available to the competent authority. This 
is evident from the response of the Netherland’s exchange of information 
partners. They have been appreciative of the willingness of the authorities to 
provide information even in the cases where the statutory time for retaining 
the accounting information had expired.
A.1. Ownership and identity information
Jurisdictions should ensure that ownership and identity information for all relevant 
entities and arrangements is available to their competent authorities.
57. The formation, management and dissolution of business entities in 
the Netherlands are governed by the Civil Code (CC), Commercial Register 
Act 2007 and Commercial Register Decree 2008. Book 2 of the CC deals 
with legal persons, while non-legal persons (partnerships) are governed by 
the Book 7a. Legal entities can be established in the form of a private com-
pany with limited liability, a public limited liability company, an association, 
a co-operative or a foundation. A legal person is created through a deed 
signed by a notary (Art.4 Book 2 ).
58. The Netherlands has a common commercial register for the registra-
17
tion of all undertakings and legal persons and it is compulsory for all legal 
entities to be registered. This register contains general information on the 
constitution of such entities. The information available in the commercial 
18
register is publicly available and can be accessed online on payment of a fee.
59. In the Caribbean Netherlands, the corporate law can be found in 
19
the Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and the Commercial Code (Wetboek 
van Koophandel). The registration of companies is regulated by the Law on 
17. Article 2 of the Commercial Register Decree 2008 states that, an undertaking 
exists if there is an independently operating organisational unit of one or more 
persons through which, by means of a sufficient contribution of work or funds by 
third persons, services or goods are supplied or works are completed with a view 
to making a reasonable profit. No undertaking exists if the volume of activities 
or turnover is insignificant according to the Decree.

 Associations (Title 2, Book 2) : An Association is a legal person 
formed for a particular purpose, different than that of co-operative or 
mutual insurance society, by means of a multilateral juridical act. An
association may not distribute profits among its members;
European companies (Europese Vennootschap; SE): SEs are regu-
lated by European Council Regulation (EC) 2157/2001 of 8 October 
2001 on Statute for a European Company which provide for the crea-
tion and management of companies with a European dimension, free 
from the territorial application of national company law. Pursuant to 
Section 10 of the European Regulation, the rules applicable to public 
limited companies apply to these types of companies. The Netherlands 
law of 17 March 2005, Official Journal 2005, 150 (Uitvoeringswet ver-
ordening Europese vennootschap) deals with SEs; and
 European co-operative societies (Europese Cooperatieve 
Vennootschap; SCE): European Council Regulation (EC) 1435/2003 
of 22 July 2003 on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society 
provides for the establishment of such companies in the EU Member 
States. The Netherlands’ Law of 14 September 2006, Official Journal 
2006, 425 (Uitvoeringswet verordening Europese cooperatieve ven-
nootschap) regulates these companies in the Netherlands. SCEs are 
subject to the same registration requirements as BVs and NVs.
61. Statistics on legal persons are kept by the Central Bureau of Statistics 
and the Chamber of Commerce. As of 31 December 2009, a total of about 
1.1 million domestic and 7 000 foreign and European companies were regis-
tered with the Chamber of Commerce, comprising 753 960 BVs, 3 642 NVs, 
5 277 co-operative societies, 117 398 associations, and 6 905 foreign corpo-
rations. BVs are mainly used for smaller business and are privately owned.
NVs are commonly used to engage in banking or insurance business or for 
companies to be listed on a stock exchange. Further, there are 3 SEs and 33 
SCEs registered in the Netherlands.

62. Legal entities established under the Netherlands’ law require a deed 
of incorporation executed before a civil law notary (Art.4 Book 2 ).

poration of NVs and BVs respectively. Both NVs and BVs are incorporated by

returns for registration in the commercial register (Art.6 Commercial 
Register Decree). For all entities, including undertakings and legal persons 
established outside the Netherlands, the person charged with the day-to-day 
management of the principle place of business or the authorised commercial 
agent designated by the undertaking or the legal person must file the return 
for registration (Art.18 CRA). The return must contain, amongst other things, 
an officially certified copy of the deed of incorporation (Arts.69 and 80 
Book 2 CC).
68. Article 22 of the Commercial Register Decree 2008 stipulates that 
for NVs, BVs, SEs and SCEs, registration involves provision of information 
on personal particulars of each director and supervisory board member and 
25
other persons who are authorised to represent the company. Information on 
the authorised capital and the amount of the issued and paid-up capital is also 
recorded. Information on the owners of non-fully paid up shares needs to be 
registered and consists of personal particulars, the holding of each share-
holder and the amount paid on such shares. Additionally, where all shares 
are held by one person, information on that person is also provided as part of 
registration.
69. Article 4 of the Commercial Register Decree authorises the Chamber 
of Commerce to investigate the completeness and accuracy of the information 
provided before it finalises registration. It verifies whether the return is filed 
by the authorised person and that the return is not in conflict with data from 
another register or data already recorded on the undertaking or legal person.
70. Legal entities and undertakings are obliged to notify the Chamber of 
Commerce within one week of any change in the particulars recorded in the 
commercial register. In addition, a database of all residents of the Netherlands 
26
is maintained by the municipalities and any changes to the information in 
24. The Chamber of Commerce has set forms for registering a legal entity, a branch 
or for changes to a registration. Forms are available on www.kvk.nl/english/,
accessed 1 June 2011.
25. Article 10(2) of the Commercial Register Act 2007 refers to personal particulars 
which include, name, address, gender, place and country of birth.
26. The records are maintained pursuant to Municipal Database (Personal Records) 
Act and contain information regarding all residents in the municipality. This 
includes personal and address details of all residents. The database is used as 
a source of information by various organisations, including the Chamber of 
Commerce and the Tax and Customs Administration.

Institutions in the financial, securities and insurance sectors
76. Access to the financial markets of the Netherlands is regulated by 
27
the Act on Financial Supervision (AFS). The Central Bank (DNB) and the 
Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) are the supervisory authorities 
under this Act. The DNB grants licenses for conducting the business of a 
clearing institution, credit and financial institution, re-insurer, life insurer 
and non-life insurer, business of funeral expenses and benefits in kind insurer 
and business of an entity for risk acceptance. Licenses for conducting the 
business of offering investment objects, offering credit, offering units in 
collective investment schemes, performing advisory services in respect of 
financial products other than financial instruments, performing brokerage 
services, performing reinsurance brokerage services, acting an authorised 
agent or authorised sub-agent, providing investment services and performing 
investment activities and systematic internalisation are granted by the AFM.
The vast majority of the companies engaged in these regulated businesses 
take the form of NVs or BVs, supplemented by a small number of co-opera-
tives and mutual insurance societies.
77. Requirements to be fulfilled in order to obtain a license include, 
amongst other things, provision to the licensing authority of information on 
the control and operational structure of the party (Sections 3:16, 3:17, 4:13, 
4:14 and 4:15 AFS). The relevant licensing authority can access informa-
tion and verify the control structure of these entities (AFS ss.1:72 and 1:74).
The licensed entities are also subject to various reporting requirements and 
a public register containing various information (not including ownership 
information) is maintained (AFS s.1:107).
Foreign companies
78. A foreign company can conduct business in the Netherlands without 
setting up a Netherlands company. The Netherlands’ international private law 
is based on the incorporation doctrine, which means that an entity is regulated 
according to the laws of the country of incorporation. Foreign companies that 
28
have an undertaking in the Netherlands are required to be registered in the 
Netherland’s commercial regsiter. The Netherlands had 6 905 foreign compa-
nies’ undertakings registered with the Chamber of Commerce in accordance 
with the Commercial Register Decree as of 31 December 2009. Of these 6 905 
foreign companies, 45 had their main office in the Netherlands.
79. With regards to registration of undertakings of foreign companies, 
Article 10 of the Commercial Register Decree provides that if the person to 
27. Act of 28 September 2006, which came into force on 1 January 2007.

the preceding financial year is closed. When a tax return is not filed, the tax 
inspector may issue an estimated assessment.
84. Tax resident companies are required to provide information on all 
shareholders in tax returns (Form VPB 082), indicating the name, address, 
city of residence and country code for shareholders if resident abroad. For 
stock registered NVs, information only on the shareholders with an interest of 
5% or more in the company needs to be provided. As domestic companies are 
obliged to file tax returns on an annual basis, information on the shareholders 
available with the tax authorities is updated annually.
85. Pursuant to Article 4.6 of the Individual Income Tax Act 2001, any 
natural person resident in the Netherlands holding an interest of 5% or more 
in a domestic or foreign company must file an annual tax return. Likewise, 
non-resident natural persons holding 5% or more interest in a Netherlands 
company need to file an annual tax return (Art.7.5(1) Individual Income Tax 
Act). Similar obligations apply to resident and non-resident legal persons 
(arts. 13 and 17 of the Corporate Tax Act 1969).
86. A foreign company having its effective place of management in the 
Netherlands is considered as tax resident in the Netherlands and is subject 
to tax on its worldwide income. They are subject to identical tax obligations 
as apply to domestic companies and file tax returns (Form VPB-082). They 
must provide identity information on all their shareholders. Accordingly, 
information on the ownership of the foreign companies having sufficient 
nexus with the Netherlands is available to the competent authority.
Ownership information held by companies
87. The management of a public limited liability company (NV) is 
obliged to keep a register recording the names and addresses of all holders 
(legal owners) of registered shares (not holders of bearer shares – see further 
below) (Book 2 Art.85). The records must also state the date of acquisition of 
shares. Information on the persons who have a right of usufruct or pledge in 
respect of shares also needs to be recorded (Book 2 Art.85 CC). The register 
of shareholders must be kept updated and kept at the office of the company, 
which may or may not be in the Netherlands. Similar provisions apply to BVs, 
who can issue only registered shares (Book2 Art.194).
88. The shares of an unlisted NV can be transferred through a notarial 
deed. The shares of a listed NV can be transferred through a private deed and 
the corporation must acknowledge such transfer. The issuance of new shares 
or transfer of shares of a BV can take place through a notarial deed only.
89. Further, all data and information which may be of importance to 
the levying of taxes on that person should be accessible by tax inspectors

customers’ ownership and control structure. Further, Article 3(2)(d) of the 
WWFT obliges the institution to carry out constant monitoring of the busi-
ness relationship and the transactions conducted during the existence of the 
relationship.
92. As the definition of beneficial owner does not include persons who 
hold less than a 25% interest in a legal person or control less than 25% of 
the assets of a foundation or trust, the AML requirements do not provide for 
recording by service providers of full information on the owners of legal enti-
ties or persons who hold less than a 25% interest in a trust.
93. Trust and Company Service Providers (TCSPs) in the Netherlands 
are governed by the Act on the Supervision of Trust Offices (Wet toezicht 
trustkantoren; Wtt) and Implementing Regulation on Sound Operational 
Management of Trust Offices (Regeling integere bedrijfsvoering Wet toezicht 
trustkantoren; Rib Wtt). A legal entity, partnership or natural person either 
by itself or together with other legal entities, partnerships or natural persons 
33
can provide a specified range of trust and company services in a profes-
sional capacity or on a commercial basis on the instructions of another legal 
entity, partnership or natural person (Art.1(a) Wtt). These service providers 
are referred to as “Trust Offices” in the Act.
94. Working as a trust office without a licence from the Central Bank 
34
(the DNB) is prohibited. The supervisory authority maintains a register of 
all licensed trust offices (Art.7 Wtt).
95. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Act on the Supervision of Trust Offices, 
trust offices are subject to rules regarding their administrative organisation, 
including the financial accounting system and internal control such that:
33. Section 1(d) of the Wtt specifies such services as: being a manager or partner of 
a legal entity or partnership; making an address or correspondence address as 
referred to in ss.9(1)(b) and 10(a) of the Trade Registry Decree available to a legal 
entity or partnership, if at least one of the ancillary activities of providing advice 
or assistance in the area of private law, providing tax advice or preparing tax 
returns and related work, performing work in connection with preparing, review-
ing or auditing financial statements or keeping accounting records or recruiting a 
manager for the legal entity or partnership; selling a legal entity; being a trustee 
within the meaning of the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts 
and on their Recognition; or other services designated by an order in Council.
34. However, the DNB and other government entities authorised by the Minister 
of Finance or the supervisory authority can provide services as a Trust Office 
without obtaining a licence.

securities to the public and also obligations for issuers whose securities 
are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating in the 
Netherlands. Section 5.25(a) defines a shareholder as “a party that, whether 
or not for its own account, directly or indirectly hold shares or depository 
receipts for shares in an issuer”. This definition indicates that it is possible for 
a person to legally own shares for another person.
100. The Netherlands’ laws do not oblige nominees to disclose to the 
company or government authorities the fact that they are nominees or any 
information on the persons on whose behalf they hold shares. The beneficial 
owners of shares are also not subject to any disclosure requirement. The com-
pany’s register of shareholders is not required to indicate whether the share is 
held by a nominee.
101. If a TCSP acts for another person, holding shares on his behalf, it 
must under the Trust Office Act identify its client. The provisions of the 
AML law also require all obliged entities, which include a wide range of pro-
36
fessionals who could be expected to undertake nominee activity on a profes-
sional basis, to conduct customer due diligence and verify the identity of the 
person for whom the shares are held. If persons not covered by the provisions 
of the AML law act as nominees, they need not identify the persons for whom 
they act.
102. Where a nominee is a customer of a financial institution or other 
service provider (with the exception of TCSPs, due to their obligation under 
the Trust Office Act), the financial institution/service provider is not likely 
to hold any information on the nominee relationship as these entities are not 
obliged under the AML law to identify beneficial owners behind natural per-
37
sons who are their customers.
36. The persons covered under the AML Law include: credit institution; financial 
institution; money transfer office; life insurer; investment firm; financial service 
provider; trust office as referred in the Supervision of Trust Offices Act; external 
chartered accountant; external accounting consultant or tax advisor insofar as 
they act in the course of their professional activities; natural person, legal person 
or company providing advice or assistance as a lawyer, notary with regard to 
services including the incorporation or management of companies, legal persons 
or similar bodies referred to in Art.2(1)(b) GSTA.
37. The Netherlands’ authorities have indicated that a legislative proposal contain-
ing amendments of the WWFT is expected to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
This proposal is currently open for public consultation: www.internetconsultatie.
nl/wwft. The amended act will required obliged entities to identify the beneficial 
owners of legal and natural persons who are their customers and take risk-based 
and adequate measures to verify their identities. Obliged entities will also, where

least a 25% interest. While financial institutions and service providers are not 
required to identify the beneficial owners behind nominees who are natural 
persons, the Income Tax Act is likely to result in information being submit-
ted to the Tax and Customs Administration on the natural persons with a 5% 
interest in a company. The small remaining gap in information required to be 
available on the ownership chain behind nominees should be monitored by 
the Netherlands authorities to ensure it does not in any way interfere with the 
effective exchange of information in tax matters.
106. None of the Netherlands’ peers which provided input to this review 
indicated difficulties concerning obtaining information on companies where 
a nominee is involved.
Conclusion – The Netherlands
107. Mechanisms are in place in the Netherlands which ensure the avail-
ability of identity and ownership information for companies. In most cases 
information on the identity of companies is available with the Chamber of 
Commerce due to companies’ registration and filing obligations. In addition, 
information on the shareholders of BVs and holders of registered shares of 
NVs is available in the registers of shareholders maintained by companies.
Information on the owners of tax resident companies must be available in 
the corporate tax returns, which is updated annually. For foreign companies 
which are tax resident, information on the owners is similarly provided in 
tax returns. Information on the members of co-operatives is available with 
the co-operatives’ management and with the Chamber of Commerce. There 
is a small gap in the availability of ownership information for companies: 
there is no legal requirement to keep information on the members of asso-
ciations and service providers will hold information on those members who 
hold at least a 25% interest in the associations. It is recommended that the 
Netherlands monitor this issue to ensure that there is no difficulty obtaining 
information on all members of associations if needed in order to respond to 
international requests for information in tax matters. Peer input received from 
the Netherlands’ EOI partners do not indicate any concerns related to the 
availability of ownership information for companies.
The Caribbean Netherlands
108. Book 2 of the Civil Code (Law of 27 September 2010, Official 
Journal 2010, 494) provides for the establishment of public limited liability 
companies (Art.100), private limited liability companies (Art.200), co-oper-
ative companies and associations (Art.70). These forms of company mirror 
those in the Netherlands (see full descriptions provided in Part A.1 of this 
report).

contain the articles of incorporation. These entities are required to register 
in the Commercial Register. The information on the managing persons must 
be registered. The lists of members of the co-operative societies must be 
filed upon registration and any changes in the registered information must be 
updated within one week from the occurrence of the event giving rise to this 
change.
113. The laws of the Caribbean Netherlands do not oblige nominees to 
disclose to the company or government authorities the fact that they are 
nominees or any information on the persons on whose behalf they hold 
shares. However, the BES Financial Service Identification Act establishes a 
broad obligation regarding the identification of clients by service providers 
(Art.5). The definition of services includes express reference to “fiduciary 
services” (through articles 1(d) and 3(c) of the related Decree) which may 
cover nominees, as persons acting in such a capacity would normally perform 
a fiduciary type of activity.
114. In addition, service providers who are dealing with a nominee share-
holder are required (Art.5 BES Financial Service Identification Act) to ascer-
tain whether a natural person who appears before him on behalf of a client (or 
a representative thereof) is acting for himself or a third party (e.g. acting as a 
nominee). If the latter is the case, the service provider is required to establish 
the identity of that third party with the help of documents to be submitted 
by the natural person and, if the third party acts for another third party, to 
establish the identity of that other third party in the same manner.
Tax laws
115. Articles 5.1, 5.9 and 5.10 of the BES Taxation Act contain provisions 
relating to withholding tax and reporting requirements for the withholding 
agents. Article 5.1 provides that a tax is levied on those persons who receive 
distributions on account of holding of shares of public companies, private 
companies, open limited partnerships or other companies whose capital is 
wholly or partly divided into shares. The benefits on account of membership 
certificates and profit shares of the BES Islands established co-operatives 
and associations, or any distributions from a foundation established in the 
BES Islands or a special purpose fund or proceeds from an open mutual 
fund are also taxable. Article 5.9 obliges a withholding agent to issue a dated 
memorandum indicating name and address of the holder, the description and 
amount of proceeds and tax withheld to the person to whom distributions 
have been made. However, the Minister may grant full or partial exemption 
from these obligations (Art.5.9(3)). The tax law therefore creates an obliga-
tion on the withholding agent to withhold tax and can be considered a useful 
mechanism ensuring information on the beneficiaries of the entities. But, due

as on 31 December 2009 (0.4% of all domestic companies). An NV must indi-
cate in its articles of incorporation whether the shares are issued in registered 
or bearer form (Art.82 Book 2 CC). The law further provides that a registered 
share can be exchanged with a bearer share or vice–versa, as far as the arti-
cles of the company do not provide otherwise. A company can convert all 
bearer shares into registered shares by means of an amendment of the articles 
of incorporation and in that case the holder of bearer share cannot exercise 
the right of shareholder till the bearer share is surrendered to the company.
121. Information concerning the holder of bearer shares is not required to 
be maintained by the Commercial Register or in the company’s own register 
of shareholders.
122. Holders of bearer shares of listed companies can be identified via 
the central clearing institutions. In addition, for such stock registered NVs, 
information on shareholders with an interest of 5% or more in the company 
needs to be provided to the Tax and Customs Administration via tax returns.
123. Under the Civil Code, a company must be informed within eight days 
if a bearer shareholder has acquired all shares in the capital of a company and 
also if such 100% holding is reduced because some other person has acquired 
such shares (Art.91(a)).
124. The rules for the disclosure of major holdings and capital interests 
in issuing institutions impose a duty on all persons to disclose to the com-
pany when they acquire or lose shares above or below any of the following 
41
thresholds: 5% , 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 
95% (Art. 5:38 Act on Financial Supervision).
125. Under the tax law, the natural persons (Art.4.6 Income Tax Law) and 
legal persons (Art.13 Corporate Tax Law) who hold an interest of 5% or more 
in the company (the “controlling shareholders”) are obliged to declare this in 
their tax returns.
126. Corporate tax returns for unlisted NVs require information on all 
shareholders indicating the name, address, city of residence and country 
code for shareholders if resident abroad. If they do not, sanctions apply. It is 
unclear that in absence of the requirement to keep information on the bearer 
shares and the absence of obligations on them to know the current holder of 
bearer shares which can be traded anonymously, how the company could 
fulfil this obligation.
127. In accordance with Article 3 of the WWFT, financial institutions, 
accountants and company service providers must identify their customers, 
including those who open securities portfolios.
41. A bill currently before Parliament proposes to lower this threshold to 3%.

133. Some limited mechanisms exist with respect to information on the 
owners of bearer shares:
 under the BES Income Tax Act, a natural person who holds an 
interest of 5% or more in the company (a controlling shareholder) is 
obliged to declare this in his/her tax return (Art.11); and
 under the AML/CFT framework in the Caribbean Netherlands (see 
previous), financial institutions, accountants and company service 
providers are obliged to establish the identity of their customers, 
including those who open securities portfolios.
134. Information about bearer shares issued in the Caribbean Netherlands 
is not available.
135. As no exchange of information related to the Caribbean Netherlands 
has occurred to date, no comment has been received from peers as to the 
availability of information related to companies with bearer shares.
Partnerships (ToR A.1.3)
The Netherlands
136. Under Netherlands law, partnerships are not legal entities and they 
cannot acquire title to property. Four types of partnerships can be established:
civil partnership (maatschap): This is a contractual form of part-
nership commonly used by professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, 
dentists or architects. Partners are jointly and severally liable for debts 
arising out of legal acts engaged upon by each of them on behalf of the 
partnership. The rules for these partnerships are included in Book 7A, 
Title 9 of the Civil Code. The Netherlands had 29 675 registered part-
nerships in May 2011;
 firm or general partnership (vennootschap onder firma; v.o.f):
This form of partnership is mainly used by contractors, carpenters or 
painters. It is operated like a company for third parties. Partners are 
jointly and severally liable to creditors of the partnership. As at April 
2011, 159 642 firms were registered with the Chamber of Commerce;
 limited partnership (commanditaire vennootschap; CV):This 
form of partnership is similar to the firm but with one or more silent 
partners (commanditaire vennoten) that are only liable to the extent 
of their investment. In exchange for their limited liability, the silent 
partners are not allowed to engage in any activity on behalf of the 
PEER REVIEW REPORT – COMBINED PHASE 1 AND PHASE 2 REPORT – THE NETHERLANDS © OECD 2011

Administration upon request. If the partner is a legal person or partnership 
under foreign law, the number under which the legal person or partnership 
has been registered in the foreign register, the name of the register and the 
place and country where the register is kept must be recorded in the commer-
cial register (Art.26 Commercial Register Decree).
138. Partnerships are not subject to corporate income tax and are treated 
as transparent for tax purposes. The share of income from these partnerships 
is directly taxed in the hands of the partners. Partners, resident and non-
resident, are required to file tax returns with the tax authorities and thus the 
Tax and Customs Administration holds information on all partners, including 
limited partners who earn Netherlands-sourced income. The list of partners 
with Netherlands-sourced income in a partnership can be compiled from the 
database of the Tax and Customs Administration. Nevertheless, information 
on any foreign partners of a partnership established in the Netherlands but 
carrying on activities outside of the Netherlands may not be available to tax 
authorities, as such partners need not file tax returns.
139. For EEIGs, an authentic copy of the contract establishing the group-
ing must be lodged at the commercial register and information on the per-
sonal particulars of each director and supervisory board member must be 
registered (Art.23 Commercial Register Decree).
140. In addition, the WWFT applies obligations to financial institutions 
and a range of designated non-financial businesses and professions (includ-
ing lawyers, accountants, notaries and TCSPs) where they provide financial 
services to customers. These obliged entities must identify their customers 
and, where the customer is a legal entity, must identify the beneficial owners 
of that entity in the same way as discussed previously with respect to com-
panies. Thus, service providers will identify all partners who have at least a 
25% interest in the partnership which is a customer of the service provider.
Foreign partnerships
141. Where a partnership established outside the Netherlands establishes 
an undertaking or a branch in the Netherlands, that undertaking or branch 
must be registered in the commercial register. Information to be submitted 
as part of the registration includes: the personal particulars of each partner; 
the date on which s/he entered into or ceased to be in office as such with the 
partnership; and a statement of the law of the country which the partnership 
is subject to. If the undertaking’s principal place of business is located out-
side the Netherlands, information about the address of the principal place of 
business which is published in the register of foreign country must also be 
registered (Art.26 Commercial Register Decree). 6 955 foreign partnerships 
were registered as of April 2011.

Trusts (ToR A.1.4)
The Netherlands
148. Domestic law in the Netherlands does not provide for the creation of 
trusts. The Netherlands is, however, signatory to the Hague Convention of 
45
1 July 1985 on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition and 
there are no restrictions on a resident acting as a trustee, administrator or 
manager or from having the responsibility of distributing profits or adminis-
tering a trust constituted under foreign law.
149. Pursuant to the Commercial Register Act, a foreign trust that has its 
statutory seat or a fixed place of business in the Netherlands or can be consid-
ered as an undertaking must be registered at the trade register. The informa-
tion required upon registration includes details of the person administering 
the trust, but no information concerning the settlor or beneficiaries.
150. The Netherlands’ administration has indicated that trusts are not 
registered as trusts in the Commercial Register.
151. Any changes to the information are required to be updated within a 
week. If a foreign trust holds immovable property in the Netherlands, this will 
also be registered in the Land Registry database, in the name of the trustee.
Tax law
152. For the purposes of tax law, a foreign trust that has its statutory seat 
or a fixed place of business in the Netherlands is considered to be resident in 
the Netherlands. This would include a foreign trust whose trustee is resident 
in the Netherlands. A foreign trust that is resident in the Netherlands is liable 
to corporate income tax on its worldwide income and must file a tax return.
The trust’s tax return would contain the same information that companies 
are required to provide: an overview of profits and losses, a list of assets and 
debts. The trust is required to maintain reliable accounting records and all 
other data of relevance for the levying of taxes on the trust as well as third 
parties (Arts.52(1) and 53(1) GSTA). This accounting information would 
likely identify those beneficiaries who received some form of benefit from 
the trust during the tax year. According to the Netherlands’ authorities, there 
are currently no trusts resident in the Netherlands as there are none registered 
in the Commercial Register and none have submitted tax returns.
153. Trusts that are not resident in the Netherlands but which derive cer-
tain Netherlands source income or that have a permanent establishment in the 
Netherlands are non-resident taxpayers and are subject to tax on Netherlands

on a commercial basis, of a trustee within the meaning of the Convention on 
the Law Applicable to Trusts and their Recognition, is covered by the Trust 
Offices Act. Accordingly, the provision of the services of a trustee on a pro-
fessional or commercial basis is subject to licensing and the obligations set 
out in the Trust Offices Act.
157. Article 16 of the Trust Offices Act requires a trust office acting as a 
trustee to know the identity of the settlor of the trust as well as the identity 
of the ultimate beneficiary of the trust. The ultimate beneficiary is defined 
as a beneficiary of at least 10% of the assets of the trust (s.1(c) Act on the 
Supervision of Trust Offices). If there is no ultimate beneficiary, the trust 
office shall keep all information related to this state of affairs. The trustee 
must know the source of the beneficiary’s wealth as well as the purpose of 
the structure. Article 16(3) provides that if a trust office acts as a trustee of 
a foreign trust, it shall know the source of assets of the settlor of the trust.
Failure to comply with these provisions may result in a fine or the revocation 
of the trust office’s license. The Netherlands authorities have advised that 176 
trust companies are now licensed in the Netherlands, however, none of these 
companies have provided services to a foreign trust.
158. Financial and non-financial service providers and trust offices sub-
ject to AML legislation are required to identify the customer and verify the 
customer’s identity. They are also required to identify the beneficial owner 
and to take measures to verify the beneficial owner’s identity. The benefi-
cial owner is defined as the beneficiary of 25% or more of the assets of the 
trust or the party that has special control over 25% of the assets of the trust.
Further, in the case of a trust, service providers are required to “take risk-
based and adequate measures to gain insight into the customer’s ownership 
and control structure.” Changes in ownership must also be monitored. The 
information must be kept for at least five years after the end of the provi-
sion of the services. Failure to comply with these provisions can result in an 
administrative fine or criminal prosecution.
159. Thus, TCSPs and other professional service providers must when 
acting as trustees for foreign trusts always identify all persons for whom 
they act. It is not clear whether non-professional trustees in the Netherlands, 
who would comprise primarily persons performing services gratuitously or 
in the course of a purely private non-business relationship, are engaged to act 
for foreign trusts and the Netherlands’ authorities are of the view that this is 
improbable. This small potential gap in information required to be available 
on foreign trusts which use a non-professional trustee in the Netherlands 
should be monitored by the Netherlands authorities to ensure it does not in 
any way interfere with the effective exchange of information in tax matters.

anyone to whom such services are provided. Categories of professionals who 
carry out the work of trustees are obliged entities under that act (notably 
lawyers, accountants and TCSPs). Moreover, the definition of services trig-
gering the customer due diligence obligations includes “fiduciary services” 
(Arts.1(d) and 3(c) of the supporting decree) and this would cover trustees, as 
persons acting in such a capacity are fiduciaries. Nevertheless, information 
may not be available on the beneficiaries who have less than a 25% interest 
in the trust.
166. Foreign trusts that are not resident in the Caribbean Netherlands are 
not subject to tax on distribution of dividends in the Caribbean Netherlands.
For the purposes of the tax law, only a trust that has its statutory seat or a 
fixed place of business in the Caribbean Netherlands is considered to be resi-
dent in the Caribbean Netherlands. Trusts that are resident in the Caribbean 
Netherlands are required to file a tax return when distributing dividends or 
capital. Trusts that are resident are also required to keep information on the 
beneficiaries.
167. All legal entities and natural persons who carry on a business or 
practise a profession in the Caribbean Netherlands are required to keep 
administrative records, including records of their financial position and of 
all facts pertaining to their business, in accordance with the requirements 
of that business, and must retain the data carriers in such a way that at all 
times they clearly show the rights and obligations, as well as any other data 
of importance for the levying of taxes (Art.8.86 BES Taxation Act). The 
Netherlands’ authorities indicate that it could reasonably be expected there-
fore that any professional in the Caribbean Netherlands who is acting as a 
trustee or administrator of a foreign trust will maintain records pertaining to 
the settlor and beneficiaries of the trust.
Conclusion
168. In summary, if a trust office acts as a trustee of a foreign trust, 
information on the settlor and beneficiaries is available under the provisions 
of the Decree Governing the Integrity of the Financial Markets. If any other 
person is hired to provide services as a trustee, administrator or protector, 
information on the beneficiaries with at least a 25% interest in the assets or 
income of the trust is available in the Caribbean Netherlands in accordance 
with obligations under the Financial Service Identification Act. Obligations 
under the BES Taxation Act likely ensure the maintenance of information on 
all beneficiaries as well as settlors.
169. As no exchange of information related to the Caribbean Netherlands 
has occurred to date, no comment has been received from peers as to the 
availability of information relating to trusts in the Caribbean Netherlands.

contain information on the founders, the foundation council or the beneficiar-
ies. As noted in Part B of this report, such foundations are obliged entities 
under the GSTA and thus tax inspectors have the power to gather informa-
tion, including that concerning the founders and beneficiaries (Arts.47, 52 
and 53 GSTA).
175. From 1 January 2010 a new statutory regulation regarding the taxa-
48
tion of foundations that are family or private wealth managing foundations
has determined that the property and assets of this kind of foundation are 
attributed to the settlor or founder, who will be taxed on this.
176. The WWFT applies to financial institutions and a range of designated 
non-professional businesses and professions providing services to founda-
tions, in the same way as applicable when the customer is a company. The 
beneficial owner of a foundation is defined as any natural person who is a 
beneficiary of 25% or more of the assets of a foundation or the party has spe-
cial control over more than 25% or more of the assets of a foundation of the 
capital of a foundation (Art.1(f) WWFT). In addition, according to Article 10 
of the Act on Supervision of Trust Offices, trust offices must know the iden-
tity of the ultimate beneficial owner or must have information showing that 
there is no ultimate beneficial owner. An ultimate beneficial owner is defined 
as a person who is a beneficiary of at least 10% of the capital of a foundation 
(Art.1(c)).
Conclusion
177. Although information identifying the founder(s) and foundation 
council members is submitted as part of registration of a foundation, and this 
is updated from time to time, foundations are not obliged to disclose identity 
information concerning their beneficiaries to the Chamber of Commerce.
Nevertheless, under AML laws, information on those beneficiaries who have 
at least a 25% interest in the foundation is held by service providers which 
the foundation comes into contact with. Foundations are subject to tax if they 
carry on business, however, information on the beneficiaries of a founda-
tion is not required to be provided in the tax return. If a trust office provides 
services to a foundation, it needs to identify persons who are beneficiaries 
of at least 10% capital of the foundation. In practice, foundations are likely 
to maintain all relevant ownership information in order to be able to respond 
fully to requests for information from the Tax and Customs Administration.
The Netherlands’ peers have not indicated any concerns with respect to the 
availability of ownership information related to foundations.

Enforcement provisions to ensure availability of information 
(ToR A.1.6)
The Netherlands
Commercial laws
184. After incorporation, companies, associations, co-operatives and 
foundations must be registered in the Commercial Register. Article 47 of the 
Commercial Register Act refers to enforcement provisions and states: “It shall 
be prohibited to act in breach of or not to comply with any obligation set by 
or pursuant to the Act for filing of a return for registration in the commercial 
register or failure to provide information about the changes to the registered 
information”.
185. Each officer or director is responsible to the legal person for the 
proper performance of the duties assigned to him (Art.9 Book 2 CC), and 
is liable for any non-compliance. Non-compliance with the obligation of 
registration will make directors jointly and severally liable for all debts aris-
ing from their acts (Arts.69, 180 Book 2 CC). Non-compliance relating to 
registration or providing updates to registered information in the Commercial 
Register is an economic offence punishable by imprisonment for six months 
maximum, community service or a fine (Art.1(4) Economic Offences Act).
The amount of the fine for such an economic offence has not been provided.
186. For ensuring the correctness and completeness of the commercial reg-
ister, Article 41 of the Commercial Register Act requires that the Chamber of 
Commerce must arrange the audit of the commercial register once every three 
years and outcome of the audit must be sent to the Minister and published.
187. The Chamber of Commerce is authorised to wind-up an NV, a BV
or a co-operative registered in the commercial register if the Chamber of 
Commerce determines that such an entity has not fulfilled at least two of 
the four circumstances stated in article 19a(1) of Book 2 of the CC. These 
circumstances include:
 the legal person is in default for at least one year in performing its 
obligations to publish its annual accounts or its balance sheet and 
notes in accordance with Articles 394, 396 or 397;
 the legal person has not acted for at least one year upon a summons 
referred to in Article 9(3) of the GSTA to file a corporate tax return; 
or
 the director has not been contactable for at least one year either at the 
address on the record in the register or at the address registered in the 
municipal population register.

up to four years or a fine of fourth category, amounting to EUR 19 000, or 
100% of tax due (Art.69).
194. Intentional failure to not fulfilling the obligations described in sec-
tion 68, for example keeping the books and records, which results in under-
payment of taxes, can be penalised by a term of imprisonment of up to four 
years or a fine amounting to EUR 19 000 (s.69(1)).
AML laws
195. Failure to comply with the obligations under the AML/CFT law 
attracts an administrative fine (Art.27). The amount of administrative fine 
is determined by multiplying EUR 5 445 by the factor determined by the 
relevant category of the institution for which Act contain information.
Conclusion
196. There is a range of sanctions available under each of the relevant laws 
to ensure that information required to be kept and maintained or disclosed 
to administrative authorities is in fact maintained. These sanctions are of a 
dissuasive nature. These penalties appear to be dissuasive enough to ensure 
compliance, even by legal persons.
The Caribbean Netherlands
197. Article 8.74 of the BES Taxation Act prescribes sanctions in the 
form of imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of the fourth category 
(USD 14 000; EUR 9 800) for various defaults, which among other things, 
include: failure to submit a tax return or keep administrative records; failure 
to retain such records and data failure to provide complete and accurate 
information; and failure to provide other assistance as required. The inad-
vertent failure by any natural or legal person to submit any tax return or to 
submit the tax return on time constitutes an omission for which a fine of up 
to USD 1 400 (EUR 980) may be imposed by the tax inspector (Art.8.22 BES
Taxation Act). When the tax assessment is too low or the taxes have been 
under levied due to intent or gross negligence of the taxpayer, a fine of up to 
100% of the assessment may be imposed (Art.8.25).
198. Non-compliance with requirements to register in the commercial 
register or default in informing the Chamber of Commerce of changes in 
registered information can be sanctioned with a fine of up to USD 28 000 
(EUR 19 600).

Identification Act as applicable to service providers may invite fines of

A.2. Accounting records
Jurisdictions should ensure that reliable accounting records are kept for all 
relevant entities and arrangements.
General requirements (ToR A.2.1)
The Netherlands
Civil Code requirements
201. Article 10(1) of Book 2 of the CC imposes a general record–keep-
ing requirement for legal persons and provides that “the management must 
administer the financial condition of the legal person and everything relating 
to its activities as such activities may require and keep the books, records and 
other data pertaining thereto in such a manner that its rights and obligations 
can be ascertained at any time”.
202. The management of a legal person is also required to prepare 
within six months from the end of each financial year a balance sheet and 
a statement of income and expenditure or the annual accounts and report 
(Arts.10(2), 49, 58, 101, 210 and 300 CC). The management board of the entity 
must deposit these accounts, duly signed by each member of the Management 
Board, for inspection by the members or shareholders at the office. The 
Management Board must also submit the annual accounts for adoption to the 
General Meeting.
203. The accounting standards of the Netherlands are based on the Fourth 
Council Directive of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of 
companies and the Seventh Council Directive on consolidated accounts of 
13 June 1983.
204. Article 362 of Book 2 contains general requirements for the prepa-
ration of the accounts. The annual accounts must provide, on the basis of 
generally accepted accounting principles, such insights that an informed 
assessment can be made about the legal person’s property (assets and liabili-
ties) and, insofar as the nature of annual accounts permits, about its solvency 
and liquidity. The balance sheet and explanatory notes thereto must fairly; 
clearly and consistently show the size and composition of the property at the 
end of the financial year, expressed in assets and liabilities. Similarly, the 
profit and loss account and explanatory notes must fairly, clearly and consist-
ently show the profit amount for the financial year and how this is deduced 
from the income and expenditure items.
205. The detailed rules relating to arrangement of data in the annual 
accounts and notes, items relating to assets and liabilities, profit and loss

Supervision (Chapter 5), must make its annual financial accounts available to 
the public, within four months of the end of the financial year and must be kept 
available for at least five years (s.5:25(c)).
211. Section 6 of the Regulation on Sound Operational Management relat-
ing to the Act on the Supervision of Trust Offices relates to the “Segregation 
of assets”. This obliges trust offices to take measures with respect to monies 
or cash equivalents of object companies or third parties managed by them 
to protect the rights of those object companies or third parties. This provi-
sion must to a large extent ensure the keeping of the accounting records and 
underlying documents by the trust offices in respect of entities managed by 
them. This regulation would benefit from a more detailed description of the 
accounting records which must therefore be maintained.
General State Taxes Act requirements
212. Article 52(1) of the GSTA states that “those required to keep admin-
51
istrative records must maintain such books and records of their financial 
position and of all facts pertaining to their business, independent profes-
sion or occupation in such a way and must retain these books, records and 
other data carriers in such a way that all times they clearly show the rights 
and obligations, as well as any other data of importance for levying of 
taxes”. Entities (including those who are not established in the Netherlands, 
but taxable for their Netherlands sourced income and those established in 
the Netherlands but not taxable at all) must keep administrative records 
(Art.52(2)). Article 52(3) provides that anything required be recorded, reg-
istered or prepared under other tax legislation must also be considered part 
of the administrative records. For example, the requirement to keep invoices 
under the VAT Act ensures the availability of invoices.
213. The obligations under tax laws may require trustees to keep the 
accounts of a trust which they administer so as to comply with the obligations 
under articles 52 and 53 of the GSTA for the trust itself and so as to avoid the 
attribution of assets of the trust to their account.
51. Persons required to keep administrative records are: all bodies; natural persons 
who carry on a business or practice an independent profession, as well as natural 
persons who enjoy taxable profits from an enterprise as referred to in Article 3.3
of the Income Tax Act; natural persons who are required to withhold taxes or 
social security contributions; natural persons who carry on activities as referred 
to in Articles 3.90, 3.91or 3.92 of the Income Tax Act 2001.

Caribbean Netherlands
218. Article 15a of Book 3 of the Civil Code requires a person carrying on 
a business to keep records and related books, papers and other data carriers 
in such a way that his rights and obligations can be determined at any time.
219. For tax purposes, every person is obliged to provide all data, includ-
ing its contents and information relevant to levying of tax to the tax inspector 
(Art.8.83 BES Taxation Act). The failure to provide information, data and 
indications is a punishable offence. Tax law and commercial law require-
ments ensure availability of underlying documents.
Document retention (ToR A.2.3)
The Netherlands
Civil Code requirements
220. General requirements for retaining records are specified in Book 2
of the Civil Code. The management is obliged to retain the books, records 
and other data for seven years (Art.10(3)).The financial year is generally 
the calendar year in the Netherlands. Legal persons are obliged to keep all 
documents relating to annual accounts and their annual report for seven years 
(Art.394(6) Book 2).
221. The registered particulars in respect of a legal person must be kept for 
ten years after the date on which the legal person ceased to exist consequent 
to winding up proceedings (Art.19(7)). Further, pursuant to Article 24, the 
books, records and other data of a legal person which has been wound up 
must be retained for seven years after the legal person has ceased to exist.
Financial Supervision Act requirements
222. Article 14(5) of the Decree on Prudential Rules, issued pursuant to 
the Act on Financial Supervision obliges the regulated financial institutions 
to maintain its own records and client records for a minimum of five years 
after the services have been provided.
General State Taxes Act requirements
223. For tax purposes, administrative records must be retained for a 
period of seven years (Art.52(2) GSTA). Further, Article 52(6) requires that 
administrative records must be organised and kept in such a way and the data 
retained in such a way that an audit can be conducted by the inspector within 
a reasonable time. The person required to keep the administrative records

accounting records and underlying documents to be maintained with respect 
to foreign trusts which have a trustee in the Netherlands are not specified.
230. The responses of the peers on the receipt of the accounting informa-
tion are positive. In urgent cases the information was provided in time. Some 
peers have commented that the Netherlands has provided accounting infor-
mation even after the expiry of the statutory retention period of seven years.
They have also received copies of invoices and agreements. However, most 
of them expressed concern that information is generally received late. They 
perceive that delay is caused due to domestic notification procedure but they 
appreciate that this is generally beyond their control.
The Caribbean Netherlands
231. Obligations contained in the BES Taxation Act, the Civil Code 
and AML laws mirror those in place in corresponding legislation in the 
Netherlands and oblige all relevant entities and to maintain comprehensive 
accounting records and underlying documents for a minimum of five years.
The precise nature of the accounting records and underlying documents 
to be maintained with respect to foreign trusts which have a trustee in the 
Netherlands are not specified. As no exchange of information has occurred to 
date, no input has been received from peers as to the availability of account-
ing information.

B. Access to information
Overview
239. A variety of information may be needed in a tax enquiry and jurisdic-
tions should have the authority to obtain all such information. This includes 
information held by banks and other financial institutions as well as informa-
tion concerning the ownership of companies or the identity of interest holders 
in other persons or entities, such as partnerships and trusts, as well as account-
ing information in respect of all such entities. This section of the report 
examines whether the Netherlands’s legal and regulatory framework gives 
the authorities access powers that cover all relevant people and information, 
and whether rights and safeguards are compatible with effective exchange of 
information. It also assesses the effectiveness of this framework in practice.
240. The procedure followed by the Netherlands’ competent authority – 
the central liaison office (CLO) – in order to access information to respond 
to incoming requests for information depends on the source of information.
Requests are responded to directly, without seeking the assistance from other 
areas of the tax administration or other authorities, if the information is 
available in the database of the tax administration or the databases of public 
authorities, to which the CLO has direct access. Otherwise, the required 
information is obtained from the relevant tax administrative region through 
a network of designated regional liaison offices (RLOs).
241. When the information requested by a foreign authority is not already 
in the possession of the Tax and Customs Administration, the regional tax 
office responsible for the entity which holds the information uses their 
powers available under the GSTA to carry out an inquiry to gather infor-
mation from the taxpayer or third parties (including financial institutions).
Officers of the Tax and Customs Administration are empowered to request 
required information from the taxpayer or third parties. The Tax and Customs 
Administration may also, by request, visit business premises. In most cases 
third parties co-operate voluntarily, so only very rarely is a court order 
needed to compel the production of information.

246. The Director of the Belastingregio Oost Tax Region has granted 
a sub-mandate to the Belastingdienst/Oost/Central Liaison Office Almelo 
(CLO), which is the central executive competent authority for exchange of 
information for tax purposes in accordance with double taxation conventions 
(DTCs) and taxation information exchange agreements (TIEAs). The CLO
has a dedicated team dealing with mutual administrative assistance in the 
areas of direct taxes, value-added tax (VAT) and recovery of taxes. The CLO
also acts as the competent authority for the exchange of information in rela-
tion to the Caribbean Netherlands.
247. The Tax and Customs Administration is divided into 14 administra-
tive regions (1 of which is the Caribbean Netherlands). As of 1 January 2010, 
each tax region has a Regional Liaison Office (RLO), which serves as a link 
between the CLO and the tax inspectors in the region. The RLOs are respon-
sible for forwarding requests for information to the officers in the region 
(considering allocation of responsibilities in the region for management of 
certain groups of taxpayers or for certain large taxpayers) and monitoring the 
status of provision of information by the tax inspectors. They are also respon-
sible for carrying out the Netherlands’ notification procedure for information 
requests from EU Member States.
Bank, ownership and identity information (ToR B.1.1)
Exchange of information – domestic legal mechanism
248. The Netherlands International Assistance (Levying of Taxes) Act 
of 24 April 1986 (NIAA) was enacted to fulfil obligations arising from the 
Directives of the Council of the European Union as well as other international 
55
and regional rules on mutual assistance related to the levying of taxes and 
levying of interest on such taxes and any associated administrative penalties 
and fines. Article 5 of this law authorises the Minister of Finance to provide 
the information asked for by foreign authorities that may be relevant to the 
requesting competent authority for its levying of taxes, as well as the levying 
of interest on such taxes and associated administrative penalties and fines.
249. The NIAA provides for exchange of information on request, auto-
matically and spontaneously. The Global Forum’s Terms of Reference con-
cerns the exchange of information on request only. Hence, the issues relating 
to automatic as well as spontaneous exchange of information are not analysed 
in this report.
55. VAT and excise duties falling under EU Regulations, import duties and export 
duties not included.

of Commerce (details on legal persons), real estate registration system (real 
property) and municipal databases (population register; details of natural 
persons).
254. Identity information in the case of legal persons and undertakings is 
available in the records of the Chamber of Commerce and the tax administra-
tion has access to this database. The inspector can also request specific infor-
mation from the Chamber of Commerce and other authorities under provisions 
of Article 55 of the GSTA. Further, the Tax and Customs Administration 
has at its disposal the notarial deeds with regard to the transfer of registered 
shares.
255. Information concerning companies’ registered shareholders is avail-
able with the companies and also in the annual tax returns filed by resident 
companies and by foreign companies which are resident in the Netherlands 
for tax purposes.
256. When information available in public databases or the Tax and 
Customs Administration’s network is sufficient to respond to the request, the 
CLO processes the request itself, without involvement of the RLOs. Where 
the requested information is not readily available in the databases, the request 
is forwarded to the relevant RLO for action. If the information is required 
to be gathered from the taxpayer or third parties, the case officer (auditing 
officer, levying officer or account manager) responsible for the relevant entity 
initiates an inquiry to collect the information. The case officer decides what 
kind of inquiry is needed in the particular case. He may ask information from 
the taxpayer or third party or investigate the books or even visit the premises 
of the taxpayer. The case officer prepares the audit report and sends it to the 
RLO, who in turn forwards it to the CLO if the request is from a non-EU
country. If the request is from an EU country, the RLO prepares the reply.
Access powers
257. The powers of tax inspectors and the obligation of persons for the 
purpose of levying of taxes are set out in Part 2, Chapter VIII of the GSTA).
258. Every person is obliged to provide the tax inspector all data and 
information or make available for inspection the books, records and other 
data, or contents thereof, which may be of importance to the levying of taxes 
on that person (Art.47 GSTA). The information must be provided within 
the timeframe set by the inspector. As the CLO expects a reply within two 
58
months after receipt of a request , the tax inspector will make certain to set 
a timeframe within which this is achievable.

(Arts.47 and 53 GSTA). The tax inspector will take this down, and will cer-
tify the statement under oath of office. In practice these statements fulfil the 
requests of foreign authorities.
264. Tax inspectors can also obtain information from Ministers, public 
bodies and institutions or departments of the government (Art.55 GSTA).
This ensures co-operation with other government departments.
59
265. The State Secretary of Finance issued regulation No.2011/109M
of 28 January 2011, concerning the supply of information by banks. This 
regulation sets out the procedure for the tax authorities to acquire informa-
tion on third parties from banks and how the banks must meet such requests.
The regulation requires that before seeking information from banks, the tax 
60
administration must request the information from the concerned party. If
the requested person does not possess the required information then the tax 
inspector must ask him/her to request the information from the bank. If this 
does not produce the desired result, the tax authority makes a direct request 
to the bank. While making such a request to a financial institution, the tax 
inspector indicates that the information has been requested by a foreign 
authority. There is however an exception to this procedure in that the tax 
administration can seek information directly from the bank if doing so is in 
the interests of the inquiry. If requested by the tax administration, the bank 
will not inform the relevant third party about the request for information. The 
bank cannot make the provision of information contingent on the approval 
of the relevant third party. Thus, if the foreign authority indicates that they 
do not wish the taxpayer to be aware of the inquiry, the Tax and Customs 
Administration will go directly to the bank for the information and will ask 
the bank not to notify the account holder of the request.
266. Regarding the information needed in order to identify account 
holders, the regulation provides that s/he is identified by stating the usual 
personal details and if the Tax Administration only has an account number 
without the accompanying personal details and it can be reasonably assumed 
that this account is held at a certain bank, that bank must check its adminis-
trative records to ascertain whether that is the case and, if so, must disclose 
the personal details accompanying the account. The tax administration can

No.DGB 2002/1499M (Government Gazette 2002, 58). The Netherlands has 
clarified that, a decision is a part of the body of law and is issued on the basis of 
the delegated powers. These rules are not required to be passed by the Parliament 
but have Parliament acceptance.
60. This requirement in practice amounts to the notification of the taxpayer.

well as Chapter IX of the GSTA will apply to the gathering of the requested 
information, rather than the powers under Chapter VIII. The exchange of the 
requested information will then normally take place under an MLAT, as this 
is the preferred instrument for investigation and prosecution cases. If there 
is no MLAT, the exchange will take place under the DTC/TIEA/multilateral 
agreement, as long as it allows for information exchange for the prosecution 
of tax matters. In those cases the information will be exchanged after the 
consent of the Minister of Justice in consultation with the Minister of Finance 
(Art.552(m)(3) Criminal Procedure Code).
271. The Public Prosecutor will not, in principle, have any objection to 
providing the information if either: the criminal investigation has already 
been completed; or, the FIOD and the Public Prosecutor together agree that 
the requested information does not concern issues relating to the crimi-
nal investigation. If the Public Prosecutor and the FIOD conclude that the 
requested information is related to the criminal investigation, he will com-
monly wish to postpone granting permission for the supply of information 
until the criminal investigation has been completed or until the criminal 
investigation cannot be jeopardised by releasing the information (e.g. after 
searches have been completed or suspects have been interviewed). The 
Netherlands’ authorities take into consideration the interests of the requested 
States and the interests of the domestic criminal investigation. This consid-
eration of interests may cause some delay in providing information to prevent 
the information being disclosed too early in the requesting State, thus jeop-
ardising the domestic criminal investigation. Where possible, requests may 
receive partial answers regarding issues that do not jeopardise the criminal 
investigation.
272. The Netherlands’ authorities have indicated that in 2010 none of their 
responses in the year’s 354 exchange of information cases were delayed due 
to ongoing criminal investigations. However, in 2008 and 2009 the provision 
of information was delayed due to ongoing criminal investigations in four 
cases. In these cases there was a delay of about 18 months in providing the 
information. Delays of this nature may jeopardise the inquiries/investigations 
of important cases in the requesting jurisdiction as information which is pro-
vided after a long delay may have lost value or even be unusable because of 
time limitations in the foreign jurisdiction’s laws. The Netherlands authorities 
should monitor this to ensure it does not undermine the effective exchange of 
information in tax matters.
Criminal investigations in partner jurisdictions
273. Similarly, if the information request is with regard to an ongoing 
criminal tax investigation in the requesting jurisdiction, the Netherlands will 
use the powers provided in the Criminal Procedure Code (not the GSTA)

COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS: ACCESS TO INFORMATION – 77
Compulsory powers (ToR B.1.4)
279. If a taxpayer does not provide information for the levying of tax 
(including foreign taxes), the tax inspector may estimate the assessment and 
the burden of proof shifts to the taxpayer. The court of first instance and the 
court of appeal both have the same power to shift the burden of proof if a 
taxpayer in their opinion wrongfully did not comply with a request for infor-
mation or did not file a tax return (Arts.25(3) and 27(e)). Shifting the burden 
of proof is an effective measure against non-compliance in the domestic 
assessment of a taxpayer.
280. Chapter IX of the GSTA provides for criminal sanctions for failing 
to provide information to the Tax and Customs Administration. These sanc-
tions apply to any person. Defaulters can be penalised in the event of failure 
(Arts.68 and 69):
 to provide information, data, or indications or if these are provided 
incorrectly or incompletely; or
 to provide books, records and other data carriers for consultation or 
if these are falsified.
281. If the failure is unintentional, defaults may be sanctioned by a 
term of imprisonment of up to six months, or a fine of the third category 
(EUR 7 600). If the failure is intentional, defaults may be sanctioned by a 
term of imprisonment of up to four years (or six years in case of falsifica-
tions) or the highest of the following amounts: a fine of the fourth category 
(EUR 19 000), or of the fifth category (EUR 76 000)in case of falsifications, 
or 100% of the unlevied tax. With regard to all information, including bank 
information, Article 11 of the NIAA provides that any person failing to 
comply with a request for information will be penalised by a term of impris-
onment of up to six months or a fine of the third category (EUR 7 600) or, if 
intentional, with a fine of EUR 19 000.
282. The Tax and Customs Administration may however file an appeal 
with a civil court to obtain a court order for the taxpayer or the obliged per-
sons under the GSTA to co-operate with a tax in investigation (e.g. with a 
view to respond to a treaty partners request for information), as to provide 
information and answer questions. Simultaneously, the tax authorities will 
request and court will grant damages imposed on a daily basis in case of 
non-compliance. The Netherlands authorities have indicated that in practice 
enforcing compliance for providing information through the court takes about 
three months. The taxpayer or obliged person can file an appeal against the 
original decision of the court, but regardless must comply with the order to 
provide information.

288. Article 53(a) of the GSTA states: With regard to any refusal to comply 
with obligations relating to the levying of taxes on third parties only minis-
ters of a faith, notaries, lawyers, physicians and pharmacists may appeal 
to the circumstances that they are in the capacity of their status, office or 
profession, bound to confidentiality. Article 8.88(2) of the BES Taxation Act 
an identical provision.
289. It is not expressly provided in the Bar Association Code of Conduct 
or in Article 53(a) of the GSTA that legal professional privilege is confined 
to information that constitutes confidential communication between a client 
and attorney, solicitor or other admitted legal representative, if such com-
munication is produced for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice 
or is produced for the purpose of use in existing or contemplated legal pro-
ceedings (see Paragraph 19.3 of the commentary on Article 26 of the OECD
Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital and the Commentary to 
Article 7(3) of the 2002 Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on 
Tax Matters). This could be inferred from the use of the phrase in the capac-
ity of their status, office or profession in Article 53(a) and from the primary 
role of a lawyer, which is to provide legal advice and represent clients in 
62
legal proceedings. It is recommended that the Netherlands’ authorities 
make it clear that the privilege which can be claimed by lawyers under 
Article 53(a) of the GSTA only relates to confidential communication pro-
duced for the purpose of seeking or providing legal advice or produced for 
the purpose of use in existing or contemplated legal proceedings.
290. If a lawyer acts in another capacity, for instance as administrator 
or trustee, Article 53(a) of the GSTA does not apply. This has been sub-
stantiated by the answer of the government to the question of members 
of the Parliament concerning the scope of legal professional privilege in 
Article 53(a), especially with regard to lawyers and notaries who also act as 
3. Advocates shall impose the same obligation to observe secrecy upon their staff 
as that to which they are bound.
4. The obligation to observe secrecy shall continue after the relationship with the 
client has come to an end.
5. If advocates have undertaken to observe secrecy, or if this secrecy arises from 
the nature of their relationship with any third party, they shall also observe this 
secrecy vis-à-vis their clients.”
62. However the Supreme Court (March 2, 2010–LJN BJ 9262) held that special 
investigation powers under the Investigation Act (Wet BOB) cannot be used to 
gather information covered by professional secrecy and these powers cannot be 
directed to obtain information related to activities of lawyers and notaries, except 
when such a person is a suspect or with respect to objects that form part of a 
criminal act.

B.2. Notification requirements and rights and safeguards
The rights and safeguards (e.g. notification, appeal rights) that apply to persons in the 
requested jurisdiction should be compatible with effective exchange of information.
Not unduly prevent or delay exchange of information (ToR B.2.1)
293. The NIAA requires notification of the person from whom information 
is obtained and who is living or established in the Netherlands, who may or 
may not be the party who is the subject of the request, of the decision that the 
information is being supplied to a foreign competent authority. No notification 
is required if the information to be exchanged is derived from public sources 
or the Tax and Customs Administration’s own database. Such notification is 
given after gathering the information from the concerned person but prior 
to the supply of the information to the requesting foreign authority. When 
the information is originally gathered, the tax inspector does not inform the 
65
provider of the purpose of seeking the information ; they are notified after 
the information has been obtained. The relevant provisions are contained in 
Article 5 of the NIAA. The notification contains a description of the requested 
information, a description of the information to be provided and indicates 
which foreign competent authority the information will be provided to. The

Court decided that the tax authorities were not obliged to inform the taxpayer of

information.

297. In practice, the requesting authority should make a request for urgency, 
giving reasons. The Tax and Customs Administration does not simply rely on 
68
indications of urgency from the foreign partner however. If the Netherlands 
authorities, on the basis of known facts and circumstances, concludes that there 
is a situation where urgent reasons are involved, the competent authority will 
act on that, even in the absence of an express request for the same from the 
requesting authority, and no prior notification will be sent.
298. There are therefore exceptions to the notification procedure in cases 
of an urgent nature, and, due to the inclusive definition of “urgent cases” and 
the case-by-case approach taken to deciding where the notification procedure 
can be waived, in cases where the notification is likely to undermine the suc-
cess of the investigation conducted by the requesting authority.
299. Under the notification procedure, the natural or legal person from 
whom the information originates may lodge an objection with the CLO or the 
RLO. For a period of 10 days the information is not supplied to the other coun-
try. Where there is an objection, the CLO decides on the objection through a 
written decision after weighing the interests of the State and the party con-
cerned and then provides the information to the requesting jurisdiction. If 
the objection is combined with an application to the court for injunctive relief 
(accelerated proceedings), the CLO will not provide the information to the 
requesting foreign authority until the court has reached a decision.
300. The grounds for objections are generally derived from the grounds 
for refusal of information by the State under the tax treaties, the European 
Directive 1977-799 and the TIEAs, which are incorporated in the NIAA
(e.g. information does not fall within the scope of the international rule, or the 
gathering of the information is not in accordance with the domestic law, that 
there is no reciprocity, that the information is not correct, that the other State 
has not used all the methods available to collect information, that there is a 
business or professional secret involved, or lack of taxation interest in other 
State or the person will suffer damage if the information is provided).
301. The notification procedure is as follows:
 after receipt of the letter of notification the party concerned has a 
term of 10 days to lodge an objection with the CLO (non European 
cases) or RLO (European cases). The information will not be sup-
plied during this period;
 if an objection is made, the CLO or RLO will contact the taxpayer to 
offer a personal hearing. This process can take 4 to 8 weeks, and is 
68. See paragraph 7.5.2 of General Instruction Mutual Administrative Assistance

C. Exchanging information
Overview
306. Jurisdictions generally cannot exchange information for tax purposes 
unless they have a legal basis or mechanisms for doing so. A jurisdiction’s 
practical capacity to effectively exchange information upon request relies 
both on having adequate mechanisms in place as well as an adequate insti-
tutional framework. This section of the report assesses the Netherlands’ 
network of international agreements against the standards and the adequacy 
of its institutional framework to achieve effective exchange of information in 
practice.
307. The Netherlands’ network of bilateral information exchange agree-
ments is extensive and covers its major trading partners as well as the world’s 
financial centres. Currently the Netherlands has 28 taxation information 
exchange agreements (TIEAs) plus 86 double taxation conventions (DTCs), 
69
which cover 90 jurisdictions , allowing it in total to exchange information 
with 118 jurisdictions. A list of all EOI agreements is given in Annex 2. The 
majority of these agreements are to the international standard. In terms of the 
volume of information exchanged, Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Spain 
and the United Kingdom are the Netherlands’ most significant partners.
308. In addition, the Netherlands is able to exchange information in tax mat-
70
ters with other European Union (EU) Member States under the EU Council 
Directive 77/99/EEC of 19 December 1977 (Mutual assistance in Tax Matters) 
69. The Netherlands’ DTC with the former Czechoslovakia remains in force with respect 
to both the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. Similarly, the Netherlands 
continues to apply the DTC signed with the Former Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia. See the 
State Secretary of Finance Decree of 22 September 2009 (IFZ2009/510M).
70. The EU Member States covered by this Council Directive are: Austria, Belgium, 
Bulgaria, Cyprus*, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta,

only recently became the competent authority for international exchange 
of information (EOI) in tax matters for the Caribbean Netherlands, there is 
insufficient information available at this time to comment on the effective-
ness of EOI related to the Caribbean Netherlands. The Global Forum will fur-
ther consider practical aspects of the exchange of information relating to the 
Caribbean Netherlands in detail in a targeted Phase 2 review, to be scheduled 
for the first half of 2014.
311. The Netherlands’ authorities have also indicated that they will, 
where relevant to the request, exchange information related to the Caribbean 
73
Netherlands with all of their 118 partners. In the future, the Netherlands 
intends to include the Caribbean Netherlands formally within the scope of its 
DTCs and TIEAs.
312. The competent authority of the Netherlands – the Central Liaison 
Office; CLO – bears primary responsibility for the actual exchange of infor-
mation for both the Netherlands and the Caribbean Netherlands. This respon-
sibility for EOI was transferred to the CLO, based in Almelo, in September 
2009. The CLO is properly resourced with skilled staff and benefits from 
timely expert assistance from the staff working in the tax administration.
They also have appropriate procedures for gathering and providing the 
requested information.
313. Many competent authorities have commented positively on the quality 
of the relationship with the Netherlands’ competent authority. The Netherlands 
has made important changes to its procedures, including the recently imple-
mented system for systematically providing status updates to the requesting 
parties, and has worked through a backlog of cases in the past 18 months.
C.1. Exchange-of-information mechanisms
Exchange of information mechanisms should allow for effective exchange of information.
Bilateral agreements
314. The Netherlands has signed 86 DTCs, covering 90 jurisdictions, that 
74
provide for exchange of information in tax matters. The Netherlands has also 
signed TIEAs with 28 jurisdictions. This network of 114 agreements allows for 
EOI with 118 jurisdictions. Currently, 96 of these agreements are in force.
73. This is expressly provided for in Article 8.124(2) of the BES Taxation Act.
74. The Netherlands also applies the DTC with the former USSR in respect of 
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, however, this treaty does not provide for exchange of 
information in tax matters. Thus these agreements are not analysed in this report.

76
pieces of information to its partners and received more than 116 000 pieces 
of information. The Netherlands Antilles agreed to implement measures 
equivalent to those contained in this directive on the basis of reciprocal bilat-
eral agreements signed with each EU Member State. These bilateral agree-
ments continue to apply to the Caribbean Netherlands.
319. The Netherlands is engaged in the spontaneous exchange of informa-
tion with EU Members pursuant to Article 4 of Council Directive 77/779/
EEC (Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters). Sometimes information is also 
exchanged in accordance with the Joint Council of Europe/OECD Convention 
77
on Mutual Administrative Assistance. Spontaneous exchange of information 
is also taking place in accordance with the provisions of tax treaties. In 2010, 
the Netherlands sent 30 750 records, whereas received 30 978 records from its 
partners. The Netherlands has ratified the European Convention on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters between Member States in 2004.
320. When more than one legal instrument may serve as the basis for 
exchange of information – for example where there is a bilateral agreement 
with an EU member which also applies Council Directive 77/799/EEC – the 
overlap is generally addressed within the instruments themselves (see in par-
ticular Article 27 of the Council of Europe Convention and Article 11 of the 
1977 EC Directive “Applicability of wider-ranging provisions of assistance”).
There are no domestic rules in the Netherlands requiring it to choose between 
mechanisms where it has more than one agreement involving a particular 
partner and thus the competent authority is free for any exchange to invoke 
all of the available mechanisms or to choose the most appropriate.
Foreseeably relevant standard (ToR C.1.1)
321. The international standard for exchange of information envisages 
information exchange to the widest possible extent. Nevertheless it does not 
allow “fishing expeditions,” i.e. speculative requests for information that 
have no apparent nexus to an open inquiry or investigation. The balance 
between these two competing considerations is reflected in the standard 
of “foreseeable relevance” which is included in Article 26(1) of the OECD
Model Taxation Convention set out below:
The competent authorities of the contracting states shall exchange 
such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out 
the provisions of this Convention or to the administration or 
76. All members of the European Union and Aruba, the British Virgin Islands, 
Curaçao, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat and Sint Maarten.
77. The Netherlands Antilles had signed the protocol to this convention on 27 March 
2010, which is applicable to the Caribbean Netherlands.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS: EXCHANGING INFORMATION – 93
Further, the DTC with Germany provides that the authorities may refuse to 
supply information which would necessitate extensive enquiries.
325. The limitation in the DTCs with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Slovakia and Spain will not affect the exchange 
of information to the standard in practice, as all are members of the EU and 
information exchange takes place under the EU Mutual Assistance Directive.
326. The agreements with Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic 
do not provide for information exchange in prosecution matters.
327. The DTC with Ghana signed on 10 March 2008, though consistent 
with the international standard on other aspects, provides for limited exchange 
of information from the Ghana side (the restriction does not apply to the 
Netherlands). Article 26(6) of the agreement provides that Ghana will supply 
information if such information is obtained by Ghana in the course of court 
proceedings in relation to a prosecution involving acts of tax fraud in the Courts 
of Ghana. The Netherlands authorities have indicated that they will exchange all 
foreseeably relevant information in respect of all persons under this agreement, 
regardless of any limitation in the information Ghana may exchange.
328. The tax treaty with Panama signed in 2010 contains a provision for 
exchange of information in tax matters which is identical to Article 26 of the 
OECD Model Tax Convention. However, the protocol to the agreement pro-
vide that in relation to Article 24 of the Convention (EOI Article), the request-
ing State shall provide information to the tax authorities of the requested state 
which inter alia include the name and address of the person(s) under exami-
nation or investigation and, if available, other particulars facilitating that 
person’s identification, such as date of birth, marital status, tax identification 
number. The requesting State also needs to provide name and address of any 
person believed to be in possession of the requested information. Article 5(5)
(a) of the OECD Model TIEA and its commentary is clear that the obligation 
to “identify” the relevant taxpayer, does not necessarily require the provision 
of their name and address and article 5(5)(e) states that the name and address 
of the holder of the information need only be provided “to the extent known”.
Considering this, the protocol is not consistent with the standard.
329. All but one of the TIEAs signed by the Netherlands clearly follow the 
OECD 2002 Model Agreement on Exchange of information on Tax Matters 
(OECD Model TIEA). The provisions in the TIEA with the British Virgin Islands 
deviate from the OECD Model TIEA, containing the wording that, there is no 
obligation to obtain or provide information in the possession or control of a 
person other than the taxpayer that does not directly relate to the taxpayer.It is 
unclear how the term “directly relate to the taxpayer” will be interpreted in prac-
tice as the agreement is not yet in force. Notwithstanding this variation, all of the 
Netherlands TIEAs are considered to meet the “foreseeably relevant” standard.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS: EXCHANGING INFORMATION – 95
335. It is also noted that in the TIEAs with Bermuda (Article 5(5)(ii)) and 
British Virgin Islands (Article 5(5)(b)), a requested party is under no obliga-
tion to provide information which relates to a period more than six years 
prior to the tax period under consideration. Nevertheless, these variations to 
Article 5(5) of the OECD Model TIEA appear to be in line with the purpose 
of the requirements in this provision, which is to demonstrate the foreseeable 
relevance of the information sought.
336. Item I of the Protocol to the TIEA with the Cayman Islands states 
that the term pursued all means available in its own territory in Article 5(5)
(g) of this TIEA is understood as including an obligation for the requesting 
party to use exchange of information mechanisms it has in force with any 
third country in which the information is located. That is, under this TIEA,
a requesting party cannot make an EOI request until it has sought the infor-
mation from the jurisdiction where the information is located. This may 
impose difficulties on the requesting party to make use of EOI mechanisms 
to obtain information outside its own territory and is inconsistent with the 
Commentary to Article 5(5) of the OECD Model TIEA (para.73) and nar-
rower than the international standard. The Netherlands is therefore encour-
aged to modify item I of the Protocol to the Cayman Islands TIEA to bring it 
into conformity with the international standard.
337. While the Netherlands has not yet exchanged information from the 
Caribbean Netherlands, it seems likely that the Netherlands will exchange all 
foreseeably relevant information in respect of these islands.
In respect of all persons (ToR C.1.2)
338. For exchange of information to be effective it is necessary that a 
jurisdiction’s obligation to provide information is not restricted by the resi-
dence or nationality of the person to whom the information relates or by the 
residence or nationality of the person in possession or control of the infor-
mation requested. For this reason the international standard for exchange 
of information envisages that exchange of information mechanisms must 
provide for exchange of information with respect to all persons.
The Netherlands
339. None of the TIEAs signed by the Netherlands restricts their applica-
tion to certain persons such as those considered resident in one of the juris-
dictions, or precludes the application of the provisions in respect of certain 
types of entities.

jurisdictional scope and provide for exchange of information in respect of all 
persons. While the Netherlands has not yet exchanged information from the 
Caribbean Netherlands; it seems likely that the Netherlands will exchange 
information in respect of all persons from these islands.
Obligation to exchange all types of information (ToR C.1.3)
345. Jurisdictions cannot engage in effective exchange of information if 
they cannot exchange information held by financial institutions, and nomi-
nees or persons acting in an agency or fiduciary capacity. Both the OECD 
Model Taxation Convention and the OECD Model TIEA, which are the 
authoritative sources of the standards, stipulate that bank secrecy, cannot 
form the basis for declining a request to provide information and that a 
request for information cannot be declined solely because the information 
relates to an ownership interest.
The Netherlands
86
346. Seventeen of the Netherlands’ DTCs contain the wording of 
Article 26(5) of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which states that a contract-
ing state may not decline to supply information solely because the information 
is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an 
agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in 
person.
347. The DTC with Ghana contains an equivalent wording of Article 26(5) 
of the OECD Model Tax Convention with respect to the information to be 
provided by the Netherlands, but does not contain a similar obligation for 
Ghana. The Netherlands’ authorities have indicated that they will, regardless 
of the limitation in the information Ghana may exchange, exchange under 
this agreement all information held by a bank, other financial institution, 
nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity, including if it 
relates to ownership interests in person.
348. Nine of the Netherlands’ DTCs, concerning 10 jurisdictions – the 
Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Republic of Korea, Morocco, 
the Slovak Republic, Spain, Thailand and Zambia – explicitly state that the 
obligation to exchange information does not include information obtained 
from banks or from financial institutions assimilated thereto or equiva-
lent institutions. Due to these express provisions for not exchanging bank

inability to provide information based on a domestic tax interest requirement 
is not consistent with the international standard. Contracting parties must use 
their information gathering measures even though invoked solely to obtain 
and provide information to the other contracting party.
The Netherlands
88
354. Eighteen of the Netherlands’ DTCs include the wording of 
Article 26(4) of the OECD Model Tax Convention, obliging the contracting 
parties to use information gathering measures to exchange requested infor-
mation without regard to a domestic tax interest.
355. While the Netherlands’ 68 older DTCs, applicable to 71 jurisdictions, 
do not contain such a provision, its absence does not create any restrictions 
on exchange of information as domestic law does not require existence of a 
domestic tax interest in order for the Netherlands to access information for 
the purposes of EOI (see Part B.1.3 of this report). Thus, even in the absence 
of wording akin to Article 26(4) of the OECD Model Taxation Convention, 
the authorities are able to obtain and provide all types of information without 
the need for a domestic tax interest in the matter.

356. Thirteen of the Netherlands agreements, covering 16 jurisdictions ,
limit the provision of information to information which such authorities have 
in proper order at their disposal. The Netherlands has issued the General 
90
Instruction on Mutual Administrative Assistance Direct Taxes which con-
tains information on the treaties wherein information exchange is limited to 
information available in an orderly manner. In this instruction it is stated that 
this means that a treaty partner is not obliged to execute an investigation for 
the treaty partner. Differing interpretations are possible: either the exchange 
will be restricted to the information contained in the tax authority’s files and 
databases (in which case the provision is equivalent to a domestic tax inter-
est requirement), or the exchange will cover all information to which the tax 
authority has access. The Netherlands’authorities, for their part, favour the 
second interpretation and have indicated that, notwithstanding the instruction, 
they will use all their access powers to obtain information requested under 
these 16 agreements. In addition, the Netherlands exchanges information with

The Netherlands
364. Some of the Netherlands’ agreements refer to exchange of informa-
tion in particular for the prevention of fraud and for the administration of 
statutory provisions against legal avoidance of taxes. It is understood that the 
emphasis on the information exchange for the prevention of fraud does not 
limit the EOI for criminal tax matters only.
365. As noted previously (see Part C.1.1 of this report), 17 of the Netherlands’ 
agreements, covering 21 jurisdictions, provide for the exchange of information 
for carrying out the provisions of the convention and not for administering 
domestic laws. These agreements have the potential to limit the EOI to informa-
tion foreseeably relevant for the purposes of civil tax matters only.
366. The confidentiality provisions in 16 agreements, covering 20 jurisdic-
tions – Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
France, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Kosovo, Malawi, Montenegro, 
Morocco, Nigeria, the Republic of Korea, Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, 
Thailand and Tunisia – do not expressly provide for disclosure of informa-
tion received to the authorities which are involved with the prosecution of tax 
matters.
367. All the TIEAs signed by the Netherlands contain the explicit obliga-
tion to exchange information for the determination, assessment and collection 
of such taxes, the recovery and enforcement of tax claims (i.e. civil matters), 
or the investigation and prosecution of tax matters (i.e. criminal matters).
368. The information that is subject of criminal investigations undertaken 
by the FIOD and the Public Prosecutors, is provided after the completion of 
the investigation or as soon as the criminal investigation cannot be jeopard-
ised any more. Information that indirectly relates to the criminal investigation 
is provided as long as the criminal investigation cannot be jeopardised. This 
sometimes delays providing the information.
369. The Netherlands authorities have advised that if an information request 
pertains to a case involving criminal investigation directed by the Public Prosecutor 
in the requesting jurisdiction, the Netherlands will exchange information based on 
mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and in that case the Minister of Justice is 
the competent authority. If such an instrument (MLAT) is not available, exchange 
of information in such a situation will take place based on a TIEA, the multilateral 
COE/OECD Convention or a DTC which allows for information to be disclosed 
to the prosecution. The Netherlands also exchanges information under the MLAT
where a prosecution is started in the Netherlands. In the absence of an MLAT, 
information will be provided under the relevant DTC/TIEA.

criminal tax cases involving the Public Prosecutor, the Netherlands is able to 
provide witness statements. Authenticated copies of original documents can 
be obtained by the FIOD and provided by the competent authority to partners 
under DTCs and TIEAs for civil as well as criminal tax matters.
374. Other than that one instance, comments received from partner juris-
dictions indicate that the Netherlands has always provided the information 
in the form requested by them. They have also received copies of requested 
invoices and other documents.
The Caribbean Netherlands
375. The exchange of information agreements applicable to the Caribbean 
Netherlands does not contain any restriction that would prevent the Netherlands 
from providing information in a specific form requested. The DTC with 
Norway and all the TIEAs applicable to the Caribbean Netherlands oblige 
93
the requested party to provide information to the extent allowable under its 
domestic laws, in the form of depositions of witnesses and authenticated copies 
of original records. The agreements do not oblige a Contracting State to carry 
out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative prac-
tice and to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the 
normal course of the administration of that or the other Contracting State.
376. The provisions of the relevant tax laws of the Caribbean Netherlands 
are similar to that of the Netherlands. While the Netherlands has not yet 
exchanged information from the Caribbean Netherlands, it is expected that 
the Netherlands will provide information from the Caribbean Netherlands in 
the specific form requested.
In force (ToR C.1.8)
377. Exchange of information cannot take place unless a jurisdiction has 
exchange of information agreements in force. Where exchanges of information 
agreements have been signed the international standard requires that jurisdic-
tions must take all steps necessary to bring them into force expeditiously.
The Netherlands
378. The Netherlands has a very wide treaty network of 86 DTCs allowing 
for exchange of information with 90 jurisdictions. Only four DTCs are not yet in 
92. In addition, the FIOD is empowered to obtain witness statements in their own 
right as some FIOD officials have the status of assistant public prosecutor. This 
competency is attached to them by the Criminal Procedure Code.
93. Information means any fact, statement, document or record in whatever form.

a higher status than domestic laws. Article 94 of the Constitution provides for 
the supremacy of treaty provisions over provisions of domestic law where the 
provisions in the treaty are considered to be binding for every citizen.
384. However, as discussed in Part B.1 of this report, there are some 
limitations in the legislation providing for availability of information in the 
Netherlands and in the access to information by the authorities. Thus, the 
Netherlands cannot be considered to have given full effect to these arrangements 
97
through domestic law.
Determination and factors underlying recommendations

entered into force.
In the Caribbean Netherlands, 12 out 
of 22 agreements are not yet ratified 
by the Netherlands.
97. These 18 agreements cover 22 jurisdictions: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, 
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Kosovo, Malawi, 
Montenegro, Morocco, Nigeria, People’s Republic of China, the Philippines, the 
Republic of Korea, Serbia, Slovak Republic, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia and Zambia.
The Netherlands does however have full exchange of information with seven of 
these partners (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Slovakia 
and Spain) under the EU Mutual Assistance Directive.

100
Cyprus. While the EU Mutual Assistance Directive does not meet the 
international standard for EOI, the Netherlands and other EU Member States 
exchange all types of information in tax matters under that agreement.
389. The Netherlands’ bilateral information exchange agreements cover 
its major trading partners as well as major financial centres. Its agreements 
cover 83 out of 103 Global Forum members and it has not refused to enter 
into an agreement for exchange of information with any Global Forum 
member. As the Netherlands already has agreements with most of its relevant 
partners, its priorities are focussed on updating its older agreements so as to 
bring the exchange of information provision to the international standard. It
intends to expand its treaty network with African as well as South American 
countries and conclude more TIEAs. these efforts are reflected in the recent 
revision of treaties with Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland and 
the establishment of 26 TIEAs in the past 3 years.
390. It is recommended that the Netherlands revise its agreements to 
ensure that bank information can be exchanged with Israel, Morocco, the 
Republic of Korea, Thailand and Zambia.
391. The five most significant partners of the Netherlands where the 
Netherlands is the requesting state have been (in order): Germany, Belgium, 
United Kingdom, the Netherlands Antilles and Spain. The five most significant 
relationships where the Netherlands has been the requested state have been 
(in order): Belgium, Germany, Poland, France and Spain. The Netherlands 
exchanges information with these partners on regular basis. The Netherlands’ 
Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, 
Norway, the People’s Republic of China, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, 
Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
100. 1. Footnote by Turkey: The information in this document with reference to 
“Cyprus” relates to the southern part of the Island. There is no single authority 
representing both Turkish and Greek Cypriot people on the Island. Turkey rec-
ognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Until a lasting and 
equitable solution is found within the context of the United Nations, Turkey shall 
preserve its position concerning the “Cyprus issue”.
2. Footnote by all the European Union Member States of the OECD and the 
European Commission: The Republic of Cyprus is recognised by all members 
of the United Nations with the exception of Turkey. The information in this 
document relates to the area under the effective control of the Government of the 
Republic of Cyprus.

strict confidentiality requirements on information collected for tax purposes.
Confidentiality rules should apply to all types of information exchanged, 
including information provided in a request, information transmitted in 
response to a request and any background documents to such requests.
395. All DTCs and TIEAs signed by the Netherlands and the Caribbean 
Netherlands contain secrecy provisions ensuring that all the information 
exchanged is treated as secret. These secrecy provisions are primarily based 
on the rules of confidentiality prescribed in Article 26(2) of the OECD Model 
Tax Convention or Article 8 of the OECD Model TIEA. The wording in the 
DTCs varies but in substance provides protection to information exchanged 
to the same degree as information obtained under domestic laws.
396. With regard to disclosure of information to persons or authorities, the 
wording in most tax treaties follow the standard language used in Article 26(2) 
of the OECD Model Convention, however, the treaties with Bangladesh, 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, 
Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Kosovo, Malawi, Montenegro, 
Morocco, Nigeria, Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Thailand and Tunisia 
do not provide for provision of information to authorities dealing with pros-
ecution matters in respect of taxes covered by the Convention.
397. Legal provisions regarding the duty of confidentiality apply to infor-
mation provided by a competent authority and to information obtained during 
an enquiry. The duty of confidentiality under tax laws is broad and strict. It
is forbidden for any person to disclose anything which comes to light or is 
divulged about the person or the affairs of another person during any activity 
performed for or in connection with the enforcement of the tax legislation 
(Art.67 GSTA).
398. Article 67 of the GSTA provides certain exceptions from the duty 
confidentiality:
 any statutory regulation obliges disclosure;
 it is determined by ministerial order that disclosure is necessary for 
proper performance of the public duties of an administrative body;
 disclosure is to the person to whom the information relates, insofar 
as this information has been provided by him or on his behalf; and
 in cases other than the aforementioned; the Minister of Finance may 
grant exemption from the duty of confidentiality.
399. These exceptions would be subject to the scope of disclosure of 
information as set out in the relevant DTC/TIEA. In the Netherlands, inter-
national treaties including tax treaties take precedence over any conflicting 
national law and enjoy priority over the Acts of Parliament and even over the

C.4. Rights and safeguards of taxpayers and third parties
The exchange of information mechanisms should respect the rights and 
safeguards of taxpayers and third parties.
Exceptions to requirement to provide information (ToR C.4.1)
405. All of the Netherlands’ exchange of information agreements ensures 
that the Contracting States are not obliged to provide information which 
would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional 
secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be 
contrary to public policy (ordre public).
406. The Netherlands’ authorities can decline to exchange information 
on the grounds set out in Article 13 of the NIAA which among other things 
include: if public order of the Kingdom of the Netherlands dictates otherwise; 
or if providing the information would disclose a commercial, industrial or 
professional secret.
407. Article 26(3) of the OECD Model Taxation Convention and Article 7
of the OECD Model TIEA refer to the grounds on which a request can be 
declined by the requested State. The grounds for refusal stated in the domes-
tic law of the Netherlands are in line with the standards.
408. The Netherlands may decline provision of information that would 
disclose professional secrets. The scope of the legal professional privilege 
available in the TIEAs signed by the Netherlands is similar to the Model 
TIEA and is consistent with the international standard. However, the term 
“professional secrets” is not defined in the DTCs and therefore, considering 
the provisions of Article 3(2) of the DTCs, this term would derive its meaning 
from the domestic laws of the Netherlands. The GSTA protects communica-
tion between a client and an attorney when the legal representative acts in his 
or her capacity as an attorney. There is some lack of clarity with respect to 
the scope of this privilege however (see Part B.1.5 of this report).
409. The Netherlands’ peers who have provided input to this review have 
not indicated that they have ever had a concern related to the Netherlands 
authorities’ EOI activities as relate to respect for the rights and safeguards of 
taxpayers and third parties, except that such rights cause delay in getting the 
information. It is too soon to determine whether in practice this could be a 
concern in requests concerning the Caribbean Netherlands.

to 24% of requests within 180-360 days and 23% of requests took more than 
360 days. In September 2009 the CLO in Almelo assumed primary responsi-
bility for the international exchange of information, previously conducted by 
the FIOD in Amsterdam, and the positions of regional liaison offices (RLOs) 
were created. Since that time the process of gathering and providing infor-
mation to international partners has been reorganised and the emphasis has 
been on ensuring the quality of answers and the legal basis for collection and 
supply of requested information.
413. Starting September 2009, the CLO has endeavoured to improve the 
response times. The CLO initially focussed its attention on processing the 
older request and the backlog has recently been cleared. The CLO has adopted 
new procedures and has now set a two-month target for the tax inspector for 
responding to international requests. This is a continuous process of improve-
ment and the CLO is now in a position to supply information in a more timely 
manner.
414. Some of the Netherlands’ EOI partners have indicated that in some 
cases the Netherlands has either not yet provided the requested information 
or has provided it belatedly. The CLO has indicated that delays in providing 
the information occur under the following circumstances:
 when the request is received in a languages other than English, 
French, German (which the CLO can itself translate) or Netherlands;
 the Tax and Customs Administration concentrates its activities 
(audit and assessment process) mainly on recent tax years. As a 
consequence, taxable companies are inclined to archive their book-
keeping (administrative data) and underlying documents from earlier 
years. Treaty partners can have different taxation systems and their 
activities (and thus their EOI requests) may concentrate on less recent 
years. This means that the Netherlands’ companies need more time to 
provide the requested information from their archives;
 most companies use a complex digital system for their bookkeep-
ing and this system is subject to frequent software modifications.
Requesting information from less recent years makes it harder to get 
the books and data digitally available;
 when the request concerns information which is very old and thus 
must be retrieved from archives. In such cases, the Netherlands often 
asks for additional information from the jurisdiction about the tax use 
of such old information;
 when an audit is required to be conducted to collect the requested 
information;

developments. As noted previously, in Part B.2 of this report, it is recom-
mended that the Netherlands examine the reasons of delays and improve the 
procedures to ensure the effective exchange of information.
Organisational process and resources (ToR C.5.2)
Resources
419. In the Ministry of Finance there are about 12 people responsible for 
the negotiation of DTCs and TIEAs for the Netherlands and the Caribbean 
Netherlands. Currently, the CLO, which is based in Almelo, consists of 49 
persons, 29 of whom are responsible for mutual administrative assistance and 
20 are responsible for accounts and administrative matters. These 29 persons 
work in areas dealing with matters relating to exchanges of information relat-
ing to VAT (11 persons), 9 persons look after exchanges of information relat-
ing to direct taxes and the other 9 look after exchanges of information relating 
to recovery of taxes.
420. In addition, the CLO relies on tax inspectors in the regions to col-
lect requested information. The RLOs, in each of the 13 tax administrative 
regions, also carry out the notification procedure and prepare a draft of the 
response to the requesting State in case of requests from European Member 
States. Some regions have a RLO in which officers process requests for 
information on a full-time basis, whilst officers at other regions receiving 
fewer international requests for information are involved in these matters on 
a part-time basis.
421. The Tax and Customs Administration has issued instructions con-
cerning the international exchange of information which outline the admin-
istrative processes and relevant legal matters. For example, the Instructions 
for the Decentralisation of Direct Taxation and the Instructions for the 
Processing of Requests from the EU Member States.These detailed instruc-
tions provide the guidance to all the persons involved in the gathering of 
information and providing the same to foreign authorities. No staff was trans-
ferred from the FIOD to the new CLO, but all the staff working at the CLO
were trained on the job. The CLO organises various events in which all the 
persons involved in the EOI related work are regularly updated on the new 
developments in the field.
422. The CLO uses the WBY computer application to record all the 
incoming as well as outgoing requests for exchange of information. It also 
records the spontaneous provision of information (other than automatic 
exchange of information) to and from other states and the requests for special 
mutual assistance (such as the notification of foreign documents and requests 
for foreign officers to attend Tax and Customs Administration inquiries).

ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
AND DEVELOPMENT
The OECD is a unique forum where governments work together to address the
economic, social and environmental challenges of globalisation. The OECD is also at the
forefront of efforts to understand and to help governments respond to new developments
and concerns, such as corporate governance, the information economy and the challenges of
an ageing population. The Organisation provides a setting where governments can compare
policy experiences, seek answers to common problems, identify good practice and work to
co-ordinate domestic and international policies.
The OECD member countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, the
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom
and the United States. The European Commission takes part in the work of the OECD.
OECD Publishing disseminates widely the results of the Organisation’s statistics gathering
and research on economic, social and environmental issues, as well as the conventions,
guidelines and standards agreed by its members.
