Samenvatting
Dit rapport heeft vijf delen (A-E, met daarbinnen genummerde paragrafen), gevolgd door een 
literatuurlijst en een bijlage met zeven tabellen.
A. Size, insularity and autonomy (2-40)
Allereerst wordt de vraag gesteld wat in de literatuur onder ‘klein’ wordt verstaan (4-8). Gangbaar 
is om de bovengrens van de catagorie ‘small states’ te leggen bij 1,5 miljoen (8). In sommige 
benaderingen worden nog aparte categorieën gedefinieerd voor mini-staten (< 200.000 inwoners) 
en micro-staten (< 100.000 inwoners). Anderen voegen deze beide categorieën samen of vermijden 
ze geheel, gezien de gevoeligheid van termen als ‘mini’ en ‘micro’ (6). Een overzicht van kleine 
onafhankelijke staten en non-soevereine gebieden, met bevolkingscijfers en per capita GNI, is 
opgenomen in Tabellen 1 en 2.
 Kleinheid maakt kwetsbaar en is daarmee nadelig voor economische ontwikkeling; dit is 
inzichtelijk gemaakt in de door het Commonwealth Secretariat ontwikkelde ‘vulnerability index’ 
(9). Daar staat tegenover dat kleine landen hun veerkracht kunnen versterken door een verstandig 
politiek en sociaal beleid te voeren (10). Uit vergelijkend economisch onderzoek naar economische 
groei in ontwikkelingslanden blijkt zelfs dat kleine staten in feite beter presteren dan grotere landen. 
Binnen de groep kleine landen presteren de niet-soevereine gebieden weer beter. De status van 
‘dependent territory’ brengt belangrijke voordelen mee in de sfeer van handel, hulp en veiligheid. Er 
is convergentie aantoonbaar tussen het inkomensniveau in niet-soevereine gebieden en dat van hun 
metropool (11). Kortom: politieke factoren (beleid en status) kunnen de weerbaarheid van kleine 
landen versterken en daarmee de inherente economische nadelen van schaal verminderen en zelfs 
teniet doen (12).
 Het is moeilijk een directe relatie te leggen tussen (kleine) schaal en ‘good governance’ (hier 
verder vertaald als ‘goed bestuur’), allereerst omdat kleine staten in de politicologische literatuur 
zijn verwaarloosd. Inmiddels heeft onder meer de Wereld Bank een bruikbare index voor goed 
bestuur ontwikkeld (14). Op basis van deze index zijn in 2004 ruim tweehonderd landen beoordeeld 
(Tabel 3). De uitkomst is in het algemeen redelijk positief voor kleine onafhankelijke staten. Dit 
geldt in het bijzonder voor kleine staten in Europa en het Caraïbisch gebied (17). Het beeld voor 
niet-soevereine gebieden is onvolledig maar positief (18).
 Breed vergelijkend onderzoek heeft uitgewezen dat relatief veel kleine staten, in het bijzonder 
eiland-staten, kunnen worden aangemerkt als stabiele en duurzame liberale democratieën (19-23). 
De koloniale erfenis is een belangrijke determinant van regimekeuze. In dit verband moet worden 
vastgesteld dat de grote meerderheid van de hedendaagse kleine staten ooit Britse koloniën of 
protectoraten waren (21).
 Kleine staten zijn vaak eilanden; dit geldt in nog sterkere mate voor kleine non-soevereine 
gebiedsdelen (24). Het is methodologisch problematisch de effecten van kleinheid en 
eilandelijkheid te scheiden; duidelijk is dat zij elkaar versterken (25-29). ‘Islandness’ kan zowel 
negatieve als positieve gevolgen hebben. De politieke cultuur van eilanden is vaak sterk naar 
binnen gericht. Het behoud van de eigen eilandelijke soevereiniteit en autonomie kan absoluut 
worden gesteld, zelfs waar samenwerking met andere landen of gebieden evidente voordelen zou 
opleveren. In (kleine) eilanden die deel uitmaken van een groter geheel speelt altijd de optie van 
secessie (25). Daarnaast is de afstand tussen bestuurder en burger in kleine eilanden vaak gering en 
spelen in de eilandelijke politiek persoonlijke factoren vaak een belangrijker rol dan inhoudelijke 
en ideologische (26). Daar staat tegenover dat kleine eilanden in sociaal opzicht vaak homogeen 
3

weer leidt tot risicomijdend, routinematig en gedemotiveerd gedrag binnen maar uiteindelijk ook 
buiten de overheidssfeer (50-2). Dit probleem is in het Commonwealth erkend en heeft geleid 
tot programma’s gericht op ‘capacity building’ in kleine landen, zowel door training als door 
samenwerking op regionale en subregionale basis (53-4).
 Ook al zijn de consequenties van kleinschaligheid voor bestuurlijke processen moeilijk te 
isoleren, duidelijk is wel dat schaal een complicerende factor is waarmee in het openbaar bestuur 
van kleine landen terdege rekening dient te worden gehouden (55).
C. Governance in the Caribbean (56-89)
‘Good governance’ is een sleutelbegrip in vele discussies over economische en politieke 
ontwikkeling. Het begrip heeft een sterke normatieve lading. Hoewel over de inhoud van het begrip 
geen absolute consensus bestaat, is er wel overeenstemming over de belangrijkste elementen: een 
overheid die open en transparant is ter verantwoording kan worden geroepen; efficiënt, ef fectief 
en responsief bestuur; respect voor mensenrechten; en het primaat van de wet. Daarnaast is 
het bewustzijn gegroeid dat deze principes in een lokale context dienen te worden begrepen en 
toegepast (56-7).
 Er is niet veel onderzoek gedaan juist over goed bestuur in kleine landen – onder meer omdat 
de staat van dienst van kleine landen in dit opzicht vrij goed is (57). Toch wordt deze thematiek 
ook in kleine landen serieus genomen, en in het bijzonder in het kader van het Commonwealth 
en de CARICOM (58). In het kader van dit onderzoek is in het bijzonder gekeken naar discussies 
over goed bestuur binnen de Engelstalige Caraïben. Dat betreft enerzijds CARICOM – de 
Caribbean Community and Common Market, aanvankelijk alleen de voormalige Britse koloniën 
(Commonwealth Caribbean), nu ook Suriname en Haïti – anderzijds de British Overseas Territories 
(BOTs).
 De democratische staat van dienst van de Engelstalige staten in het Caraïbisch gebied is, 
enkele uitzonderingen daargelaten, goed. Een stabiele democratie is in zichzelf echter geen 
garantie voor goed bestuur. Binnen de Commonwealth Caribbean wordt al enige jaren openhartig 
gedebatteerd over een ‘crisis of government’: achteruitgang van de kwaliteit van bestuur enerzijds, 
verslechtering van de ‘civil society’ en ‘civil discourse’ en daarmee ook van de legitimiteit van het 
politieke bestel anderzijds (59-61).
 Over het Caraïbische gebied als geheel worden dezelfde debatten gevoerd. Duidelijk is dat er 
grote verschillen zijn binnen de regio en dat de Commonwealth Caribbean er betrekkelijk gunstig 
voor staat. Toch wordt ook daar de behoefte aan verbetering van het bestuur gevoeld. Dit heeft 
tot voorstellen geleid die een geest van geleidelijkheid ademen: men kiest niet voor ingrijpende 
veranderingen in het politieke bestel (62-6).
 Naast de landen van de Commonwealth Caribbean was de voormalige Nederlandse kolonie 
Suriname het enige Caraïbische land dat na 1945 de onafhankelijkheid bereikte (1975). De 
geschiedenis van de republiek is getekend door een militair bewind in de jaren tachtig. De 
democratie is daarna hersteld, maar zowel volgens internationale criteria als in de visie van de eigen 
regering en de belangrijkste partners worstelt het land met de kwaliteit van bestuur (67-69, Tabel 3).
 Het Verenigd Koninkrijk heeft veertien BOTs, waarvan vijf in de Caraïben. De Britse regering 
stuurt niet langer aan op hun onafhankelijkheid. De relaties met de BOTs worden behartigd door 
het Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Binnen het FCO is er een Overseas Territory 
Department met ca. 70 ambtenaren. Ongeveer de helft ervan werkt in of, vanuit Londen, gericht 
op de Caraïbische BOTs. Het VK wordt in elk van de BOTs vertegenwoordigd door een Britse 
gouverneur (70-3).  
 De Britse regering legt sinds de late jaren negentig het accent op ‘partnership’ en enige 
verruiming van lokale bevoegdheden. Integratie of associatie met het VK wordt afgewezen. Het VK 
stelt hoge eisen aan de kwaliteit van het bestuur. Een leidend principe daarbij is het minimaliseren 
5

constitutionele zin inhoudelijk niet gewijzigd (94-96). Er zijn echter ernstige tekortkomingen 
geconstateerd in de kwaliteit van bestuur. Dit heeft vooral aan Nederlandse zijde geleid tot pogingen 
de rol van het Koninkrijk materieel en constitutioneel te versterken; aan Caraïbische zijde heeft dit 
geleid tot protesten tegen het aantasten van de autonomie (97).
 Kleinschaligheid wordt nog versterkt door eilandelijkheid. Het uiteenvallen van de ooit uit zes 
eilanden bestaande Nederlandse Antillen bevestigt waarnemingen over de kracht van insularisme. 
Vastgesteld moet worden dat het politiek inmiddels aanvaarde proces van volledige ontmanteling 
van de Antillen de problematiek van kleinschaligheid nog versterkt (98-9, 101).
 Terwijl de SNIJs, in het bijzonder de BOTs, een vergroting van hun autonome bevoegdheden 
ambiëren, trachten de Nederlandse Antillen juist de in 1954 verworven autonomie te behouden. 
Tegenover dit contrast staat de convergentie in de opstelling van de metropolen, die in beide 
gevallen goed bestuur wenst te waarborgen door zelf essentiële bevoegdheden in handen te nemen 
of houden (100, 103).
 Waar in de relatie VK-BOTs andere leden van de Commonwealth een rol kunnen spelen bij het 
bevorderen van goed bestuur, is dat in de relatie tussen Nederland en haar voormalige Caraïbische 
koloniën moeilijk te verwezenlijken, gezien de constitutionele en taalbarrières. Dit lijkt een 
additionele handicap te zijn (102).
 Het historisch gegroeide geheel van institutionele spelers in de Koninkrijksrelaties is zwaar 
opgetuigd, complex en weinig transparant. Het is onwaarschijnlijk dat deze bestuurlijke dichtheid 
en drukte de deugdelijkheid van het bestuur bevorderen (104).
E. A Response to the Questions Formulated in the Terms of Reference (105-23)
In de Terms of Reference (TOR) van dit literatuuronderzoek worden concrete vragen gesteld (105). 
De eerste luidt ‘Welke wetmatigheden gelden voor de kwaliteit van het openbaar bestuur in kleine 
landen?’ Het is gezien de grote variaties binnen de categorie van kleine staten en niet-soevereine 
gebieden onmogelijk op deze vraag een categorisch antwoord geven. Duidelijk is wel dat kleinheid 
kwetsbaarheid impliceert; goed bestuur kan echter de weerbaarheid zodanig versterken dat deze 
dreiging wordt ondervangen. Vandaar het belang van het bevorderen van goed bestuur, juist in 
kleine landen en gebieden (106-9).
 De tweede vraag van de TOR luidt ‘Welke wetmatigheden gelden voor de kwaliteit 
van het bestuur in kleine landen in het Caraïbisch gebied’? Om inhoudelijke redenen is deze 
vraag toegespitst op de voormalige Britse koloniën. Zowel de onafhankelijke staten van de 
Commonwealth Caribbean als de overgebleven British Overseas Territories (BOTs) hebben een 
robuuste democratische traditie. Een goed functionerende democratie is echter wel een essentiële, 
maar niet een toereikende voorwaarde voor goed bestuur. Dit blijkt wel uit de breed verwoorde 
zorgen rond de kwaliteit van het bestuur in de Engelstalige Caraïben. Er is wel consensus over 
de noodzaak goed bestuur te bevorderen, maar niet over de wijze waarop dit kan worden bereikt. 
Verbetering wordt niet in de eerste plaats gezocht in de sfeer van ingrijpende staatkundige 
veranderingen – noch in de Commonwealth Caribbean, noch in de BOTs. De discussie over 
concrete maatregelen om goed bestuur te bevorderen wordt gerichter gevoerd in de BOTs. Daaraan 
ligt een sterke Britse bemoeienis ten grondslag (110-3).
 De derde vraag luidt ‘welke overheidsdiensten zijn in het bijzonder kwetsbaar in kleine landen?’ 
Opnieuw geldt hier het wetenschappelijke onderzoek weinig ruimte laat voor generaliseringen. Wel 
is het aannemelijk dat kleinschaligheid bijdraagt aan ‘exaggerated personalism’ and governmental 
pervasiveness’ en dat goed bestuur in kleine landen dus temeer vraagt om tegenwicht en controle. 
Bestuurders dienen verantwoording af te leggen over hun beleid; dit moet zo nodig worden 
afgedwongen. Dit kan enerzijds gebeuren door het institutionaliseren van controlerende procedures 
binnen het eigen bestuurlijke stelsel en in supranationale controlerende instituties, anderzijds door de 
versterking en bescherming van een sterke lokale ‘civil society’ (114-6).

7. As the global population has grown, however, so have the criteria for determining a small state. 
In 1997 the Commonwealth Secretariat published a second study on small states in which a small 
state was now defined as one with a population of 1.5 million or below . It justified the new figure 
on the grounds of population increase (Commonwealth Secretariat 1997: 2.3). The World Bank has 
done the same. In 2000 it published a joint report with the Commonwealth Secretariat entitled Small 
States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy.  It adopted the figure of 1.5 million as well 
(up from the one million of earlier practice) adding that “no definition, whether it be population, 
geographical size or GDP, is likely to be fully satisfactory. In practice there is a continuum, with 
states larger than whatever threshold is chosen sharing some or all of the characteristics of smaller 
countries” (Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank 2000: 4). 
8. In summary, current practice suggest small states are defined by a population of 1.5 million or 
less (although other lower and higher figures continue to be offered). A list is given as Table One 
and Table Two. They are divided into sovereign states (of which there are 50) and non-independent 
territories of which there are 32. The two regions with the greatest concentration of small states and 
territories are the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Small states and economic development: the importance of the political dimension
9. The early interest in size and economic development spawned a number of studies. The evidence, 
however, proved inconclusive with the majority suggesting size had no systematic adverse impacts 
on growth. Nevertheless, economists were beginning to identify characteristics in small states which 
were likely to impact negatively on economic growth. These largely focused on ‘economies of 
scale’, which, by definition, were lacking in small states; and their relative ‘openness’ to the outside 
world. Among the most important ‘constraints’ cited were limited diversification, high international 
transport costs, difficulties in accessing external capital, diseconomies of scale in the provision of 
public services, and economies heavily reliant on external trade (Commonwealth Secretariat 1997; 
Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank 2000). These, and other features, it was argued, contributed 
to the higher vulnerability of small states as opposed to large states and left small states significantly 
disadvantaged. The precise measurement of this vulnerability was given in a technical study for the 
Commonwealth Secretariat in 2000. In a sample of 111 developing countries (34 of which had a 
population of 1.5 million or less and were categorised as small, as compared to 77 with a population 
above this level and considered as large), 26 of the 28 most vulnerable were small states while all of 
the 28 countries with low vulnerability were large. In the category of higher-medium vulnerability, 
6 of the 28 states were small states and in the category of lower-medium vulnerability, 2 of the 27 
states were small (Atkins, Mazzi and Easter 2000: Table 7). In the Caribbean the most vulnerable 
th
small state was Dominica (ranked 6 most vulnerable) followed by Antigua and Barbuda (8), 
Grenada (11), St Kitts and Nevis (13), St Vincent and the Grenadines (14), Guyana (17), St Lucia 
(18), Belize (22), Suriname (24), The Bahamas (26) and Barbados (37) (Atkins, Mazzi and Easter 
2000: Table 6).
10. The vulnerability index has proved to be a useful tool for small states to highlight endowed 
economic disadvantage. At the same time, there have been criticisms of its methodology and calls 
to further develop it through the addition of a companion resilience index (United Nations 2005). 
This index would measure the ability of a small country to recover from or adjust to the effects of 
adverse external shocks to which it is inherently exposed. It would be able to do so on the basis of 
having developed appropriate policies to withstand such shocks. A preliminary index measuring 
economic resilience has now been produced by Lino Briguglio and his associates (2006). The 
components of the index include measures of macroeconomic stability, microeconomic market 
efficiency, good governance and social development. The inclusion of the last two categories 
11

14. The development of indicators to measure ‘good governance’ is in its infancy. One of the more 
important attempts to do so has been undertaken by the World Bank. It has constructed an index 
which measures six dimensions of governance (www.worldbank.org/wbi/governance/govdata/):
1. Voice and accountability – measuring political, civil and human rights
2. Political instability and violence – measuring the likelihood of violent threats to, or changes 
in government
3. Government effectiveness – measuring the competence of the bureaucracy and the quality of 
public service delivery
4. Regulatory burden – measuring the incidence of market-unfriendly policies
5. Rule of law – measuring the quality of contract enforcement, the police, and the courts, as 
well as the likelihood of crime and violence
6. Control of corruption – measuring the exercise of public power for private gain, including 
both petty and grand corruption and state capture.
15. In the most recent exercise data has been collected for 209 countries for the year 2004. The 
authors of the index are at pains to point out that much of it is subjective and subject to significant 
qualification regarding its findings. Nevertheless, it can provide a contemporary ‘snapshot’ of 
governance in small states and territories which allow some patterns to be identified even if 
individual features, as reflected in the scores for each of the six dimensions, “remain a rather blunt 
instrument for specific policy advice at the country level” (Kaufmann, Kray and Mastruzzi 2005: 
42).
16. The basic data on the six dimensions is reported in Table Three (small sovereign states) and 
Table Four (non-independent territories). The measure used is that of ‘percentile rank’ which 
indicates the percentage of countries that rate below the selected country (subject to margin of 
error). Higher values therefore imply better governance ratings. Full data sets over the six variables 
are reported for 44 of the 50 sovereign states listed in Table One and 12 of the 32 territories listed in 
Table Two.
17. On the whole, small sovereign states appear to have a reasonably good record of governance. 
Using as a dividing line the average world total for each of the six indicators, Table Three shows 
27 states as having a positive record of governance (above the average) while 14 have a negative 
record (below average). Three states are ‘middling’ with three negative and three positive indicators. 
The positive categories are primarily composed of European and Caribbean states. The latter 
is particularly worthy of note with 10 Caribbean states so identiefi d as against one ‘middling’ 
(Suriname) and one negative (Guyana). This conrfi ms the reputation the Caribbean enjoys of 
being the most democratic region in the developing world (its indicators are above those of other 
developing country regions). By contrast, sub-Saharan African states dominate the negative category 
with only two in the positive category. At the same time, however, seven states are above the regional 
average (and four below) for sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting small African states may be better 
governed than larger ones. The most varied experience is to be found among the Pacicfi Island 
states with four in the positive category, two ‘middling’ and three negative. While no calculation has 
been done to see if this record for small states is better than larger states, it would appear to conrfi m 
evidence from elsewhere in the World Bank as reported in their Country Policy and Institutional 
Assessments that “small states’ overall policy and institutional performance has been at least as 
strong as that of larger countries” (Briguglio, Persaud and Stern 2005: paragraph 69).
18. The data on the non-independent countries is so limited that no real conclusions can be drawn. 
There are also significant inconsistencies with some, e.g. France and the United Kingdom, reporting 
13

concluding that while small size is important in fostering democracy in small states, geography 
in the form of ‘islandness’ contributes as well. Lastly, a couple of interesting inferences may be 
drawn from his work. One is that there is no specific “small-state regime constitutional strategy 
that overrides the link to different metropolitan powers” (Anckar 2004b: 216), i.e. small size in 
itself does not specify a generic regime type as is also evident in the lack of a specific pattern of 
regime change following independence. Another is that in comparison to the global total, where 
only one quarter of the world have parliamentary regimes, just over one third presidential regimes 
and just under one third absolute regimes, in microstates “there is clearly more parliamentarism, 
less presidentialism and less absolutism” (214). This redounds to the advantage of microstates, 
he argues, since “the scholarly literature on regimes, empirical evidence and most writers appear 
to favour the parliamentary model, which is found to foster a greater ability to rule” leaving 
microstates “well equipped in terms of institutional structure for managing political life and political 
affairs” (214).
23. In sum, the prevalence of parliamentarism, coupled with small size and insularity, has supported 
democracy in small states. This, in turn, has helped to foster ‘good governance’. Being small, in 
itself, is no guarantee that states will not ‘fail’. But, in general, there are grounds for hope that ‘good 
governance’, once established, will become embedded through the sustained exercise of liberal 
democracy in small states.
 
Does ‘islandness’ matter? 
24. Thirty of the 50 countries listed in Table One are islands as are 30 of the 32 territories in Table 
Two. Many of the others are coastal enclaves which often ‘behave’ as if they were islands. This 
raises the question of whether ‘islandness’ needs to be taken into account as a separate variable. 
The problem here is the overlap of the ‘islandness’ and ‘smallness’ categories and the existence 
within the islandness category of some very large and diverse states such as Indonesia and the 
United Kingdom. Nevertheless, there have been some attempts in recent years to link small states 
with islands and to isolate some of the supposedly ‘distinctive’ features of  small island states (and 
territories).
25. The most obvious is that of ‘insularity’. This was variously defined as being  ‘isolated’, ‘self 
contained’, ‘narrowness of mind or feeling’ and ‘contractedness of view’ (Shorter Oxford English 
Dictionary). The reference is to ‘island particularism’, which is expressed in a strong identification 
with the territory and a sense of ‘difference’ from others, especially other islanders who may even 
be close ‘neighbours’. The political ‘fall-out’ from this is a separate ‘political’ identity for the 
island which may take the form of sovereign independence but can also be the promotion of ‘island 
autonomy’ within a larger political unit. By the same reasoning, political integration which weakens 
autonomy or sovereignty is not welcome and is to be resisted, in spite of compelling economic 
arguments as to the benefits such integration can bring. More to the point, secession is always a 
possibility within various ‘co-operative and integrative arrangements’. The examples to be found 
in the Caribbean illustrating these points are too numerous to mention but they have expressed 
themselves in one distinctive way: hyphen-identity. The Caribbean as a region is almost unique in 
the world in possessing sovereign countries linking territories together in their official designation – 
hence Antigua & Barbuda; St Kitts & Nevis; St Vincent & the Grenadines; and Trinidad & Tobago.
26. Islands can also be remote – geographically and/or in terms of ‘insularity’. Remoteness is 
“likely to promote feelings of fellowship and a sense of community. When people live at a distance 
from the outside world, they are likely to develop a spirit of community and solidarity: they share a 
feeling that they are, so to speak, alone in the world and thrown upon their own resources. Remote 
15

29. In sum, while ‘islandness’ is intangible and hence almost impossible to measure, it does appear 
to condition behaviour in small states. But as so many small states are also islands, it is difficult 
in practice to distinguish ‘smallness’ from ‘islandness’. The soundest conclusion to this difficulty 
is one mapped out by Newitt (1992: 16): “Not all small states are islands and not all island states 
are small but the problem of ‘smallness’ is given an added dimension in the case of an island, and 
insular isolation can be considerably intensified if you are also small”.
Autonomy and sovereignty
30. Decolonisation has followed a pattern in which the largest countries (measured in terms of 
population) decolonised first and the smallest last. The very smallest, with some notable exceptions, 
have remained as ‘non-self governing territories’ although, as shown below, this term can be 
misleading. There are several reasons why this may be so. The first is what may be termed the 
‘costs of sovereignty’ in which non-independent countries compare their current prosperity with the 
lower levels of income in sovereign countries and opt for the status quo (Bertram 2004). A second 
is the reduction on pressures to decolonise from the metropolitan powers beginning in the late 
1980s (seen in both British and Dutch policy in the Caribbean) coupled with a declining interest in 
decolonisation issues within the UN and elsewhere. The third, and perhaps the most significant, is 
the emergence of an alternative to sovereignty in the form of ‘autonomy’. This has grown in recent 
years in what have been termed ‘sub-national island jurisdictions’ (SNIJs). These are small island 
territories which have creatively developed legislative instruments that have enabled them to behave 
as if they were sovereign states even while they remain under the domain of the larger sovereign 
state. A recent listing (Baldacchino 2005b) (claimed as non-exhaustive by the author) identifies 106 
SNIJs, 20 of which are in the Caribbean (see Table Five).
31. The use of legislation within a SNIJ to obtain ‘specific advantages’ underlines once again 
the importance of the political in securing economic development. The predominant form is the 
establishment of ‘offshore financial centres’ (OFCs) which are concentrated disproportionately in 
small states and territories. In practice, however, there are five ‘policy capacities’ that SNIJs seek to 
control to shape their destiny. Baldacchino (2004) identifies these as:
32. Powers over finance, mainly banking and insurance . The key elements here are confidentiality 
and the power not to tax. Most OFCs combine the two along with innovative financial instruments 
to act as major centres for ‘tax avoidance’. In recent years the phenomenal growth of such centres 
has occasioned moves for tighter regulation from the ‘metropolitan power’ and from the OECD and 
the EU. The partly successful resistance to such measures from small states and SNIJs, as well as 
some of the larger states with long-established interests in offshore financial services, serve to point 
out that it is not only small states and SNIJs that benefit but much lar ger and more powerful players 
in the global economy, including the major multinational companies. The Western Hemisphere is 
host to 22 such OFCs, 18 of which are in the Caribbean and 8 of which are SNIJs (Anguilla, Aruba, 
Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Turks and Caicos).
33. Powers over environmental policy, particularly natural resources. The importance of natural 
resources in small islands and small SNIJs, where resources are necessarily limited by size, is 
obvious. That does not mean that some are not blessed with high value products such as petroleum 
and natural gas or control (often only potentially) huge maritime areas rich in minerals and fish 
stocks. The benefits to be obtained from such resources, however, might not automatically be 
acknowledged unless specific recognition is given to the interests of the particular territory in 
which they are found through legislation or specific instruments such as ‘special trust funds’. 
Careful management is also necessary, especially in respect of biological diversity in small states 
17

list for the Caribbean are “free trade and export preferences with the metropole, grants and social 
welfare assistance, ready access to off-island capital and labour markets, a number of other special 
commercial/tax concessions, excellent infrastructure and communications, good health care, good 
schools, and comparatively very low levels of crime”. 
38. Although such benefits are obtained primarily from the metropolis, SNIJs can also 
constructively use the metropolis’s memberships of other organisations to gain additional benefits. 
A particularly important instance is the EU. It has adopted specific measures in favour of socio-
economic development in three outermost regions (the French departments, Canary Islands, 
Azores and Madeira) since 1981 and ‘special arrangements’ for SNIJs are in place for the Channel 
Islands and the Isle of Man, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and the Aland Islands. The 21 Overseas 
Countries and Territories  (OCT) of the EU have benefited from special trade and aid provision 
since 1957 and are part of the current Cotonou Agreement. The Caribbean territories of the 
Netherlands and the UK are covered by these arrangements, as, at one remove, are the French 
departments in the region. Various lobbies within the EU, such as the Conference of Peripheral 
Maritime Regions and the OCT-EU Forum, have been instrumental in articulating the interests of 
the SNIJs. The result has been additional support. The current Ninth European Development Fund 
(EDF) reserves EUR 13.5 billion for the OCTs for a five-year period plus unexpended balances 
from previous EDFs of EUR 9.9 billion.
39. In sum, the trend in SNIJs has been to move away from the option of the exercise of sovereignty 
to explore political partnerships that “combine elements of shared rule for specified common 
purposes with autonomous self government for purposes related to maintaining regional or island 
distinctiveness” (Watts 2000: 20). Watts has identified ten forms of political partnerships embodying 
various elements of self-rule and shared-rule, five of which are to be found in the SNIJs and small 
sovereign states in the contemporary Caribbean (see Table Six). They are: 
Unions – St Vincent & the Grenadines and Trinidad & Tobago
Constitutionally decentralised unions – Antigua & Barbuda, Anguilla, Bermuda, British 
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Turks & Caicos Islands, and US Virgin Islands
Federations – St Kitts & Nevis
Confederations – CARICOM and OECS
Federacies – Puerto Rico
Associated states – Netherlands Antilles and Aruba.
40. In practice, there is a great deal of variation within these categories as well as between them in 
relation to what is assigned to self-rule and what is assigned to shared-rule, in the specific powers 
allocated to the shared institutions and those assigned to constituent units, and in the structure 
and processes of the institutions established for shared decision making (Watts 2000: 29-32). The 
result is that there is “no meaningful threshold for island political autonomy that can be identified” 
(22) and “no single universal ‘best model’ that is applicable to all islands” (34). It all depends on 
circumstances and history. Watts therefore reiterates in his conclusion: “the fallacy of assuming 
there is a single universal ‘best model’ for all islands must be avoided” (34).

“What is peculiar about the Eastern Caribbean political system is the absolute authority 
that government somehow inherits. Government officials are able to circumvent laws that 
they have enacted. They are able to use public resources for their personal gain. While 
partisan politics is a normal phenomenon in modern democracies, Caribbean governments 
have taken the concept to its zenith. As a result, when a party is elected to power it virtually 
eliminates the opposition through patronage, control of the media, and legislative action 
where necessary.”
Or, as the title of a recent book on politics in the Commonwealth Caribbean by one of the leading 
political scientists in the region affirms, Winner Takes All (Ryan 1999).
45. Government is also said to be subject to fewer constraints from countervailing sectors, pressure 
groups and non-governmental organisations, although this is in part a contestable proposition, 
particularly since the number of these have grown in recent years. Nevertheless, the autonomy of 
government from civil society (e.g. churches, professional associations, trade unions, chambers 
of commerce) is a crucial issue and is an important feature in securing liberal democracy. More 
generally, governmental pervasiveness in small states, where anonymity is not possible and 
pressures toward partisanship are considerable, means that special attention must be paid to 
mechanisms ensuring impartiality of administration and justice. These include various constitutional 
provisions for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as administrative features such as 
public service commissions and the office of ombudsman.
46. Concerted social harmony. Small states have a lower incidence of serious civil disorder than 
larger ones. Several reasons are given for this fact, the most important of which is the observation 
that small states are more homogeneous than larger countries. There is less alienation, higher 
degrees of system legitimacy, and a basic consensus of values. Recent research has shown this is 
both wrong and right. It is wrong to attribute to small states any greater degree of homogeneity than 
larger states if the measurements used are ethnic and religious diversity. After all, some small states 
are plural societies with very high levels of diversity. At the same time if attitudinal diversity is 
measured (i.e. the extent to which there is a strong sense of local community which binds members 
together in mutual solidarity) then very small states do show less diversity than large states (Anckar 
1999). These findings point to the need to be aware of the specific circumstances of each small state. 
In highly diverse plural societies, for example, there is a risk that conflicts among groups will be 
politicised and spill over to polarise the whole community. The breakdown of the political system 
in such a situation is an ever-present danger.  Fortunately, the comparative rarity of such events 
underlines the general rule that small states manage to limit unduly divisive conflict. Among the 
more important contributing factors are elite consensus and institutional adaptiveness, which, when 
coupled with parliamentary systems and proportional representation, encourage the emergence of 
multiparty coalition government and political inclusiveness (Lijphart 1991: 146-58). To this can 
be added those features of size which give greater opportunity for citizens of small democracies 
to participate effectively in making decisions and to perceive a relation between their own self-
interest, the interests of others, and the public or national interest.
47. Pragmatic conservatism. Small states tend to cluster on the centre-right of the political 
spectrum. They do so for reasons Lowenthal has identified as ‘managed intimacy’ and 
‘conservatism and tradition’. The former is similar to the feature of ‘concerted social harmony’ and 
relates to the fact that small state inhabitants “learn to get along, like it or not, with folk they know 
in myriad contexts over their whole lives [...] they minimize or mitigate conflict. They become 
expert at muting hostility, deferring their own views, containing disagreement, avoiding dispute, in 
the interest of stability and compromise” (Lowenthal 1987: 39). It follows that dissenting opinion 
21

the higher levels of administration, with the result that staff will often be sent for training abroad 
which is not always appropriate (scale sensitive) and which can encourage subsequent ‘brain drain’, 
compounding the problem it is meant to resolve.
52. The combination of exaggerated personalism and limited resources influence the way the 
public service functions and affects the quality of service delivery. As previously noted, the public 
service is frequently the largest employer, especially in the very smallest states, and salary levels 
and productivity are often low. The lack of alternative employment and appropriate training 
means innovation and entrepreneurship are not encouraged, instead there is a reliance on routine 
administration and compliance (following instructions) along with a proclivity for non-decision-
making (buck passing) at middle management levels. Limits on opportunity means there is limited 
mobility, low job satisfaction and frequent absenteeism. While the public sector is expected to 
achieve a great deal, there is in reality a growing gap between demands on it and its capability to 
deliver, particularly in areas where there is inadequate or no spare capacity, indicating a low overall 
ability to adapt to changing conditions.
53. The issues these raise are particularly well captured in an article by Charles Farrugia, a former 
senior public servant in Malta, who weaves a number of these features together to describe ‘The 
Special Working Environment of Senior Administrators in Small States’ (1993). He argues at 
the outset that “senior public officials in small states play crucial parts in the economic, social 
and political development of their countries” and that they “contribute significantly to make or 
break the policies adopted by their political bosses” (Farrugia 1993: 221). He then goes on to note 
that senior officials “act in multifunctional roles”; that there is a “high degree of interpersonal 
communications”, which on the one hand brings politicians and bureaucrats closer to the people but 
on the other opens opportunities for nepotism and corruption; that human and material resources 
are limited, imposing “an entrepreneurial role” on senior officials who have “to originate and 
lead projects and keep abreast of development is other countries in order to adapt them to local 
needs” (222); and that the combination of such pressures and demands leads officials “to develop 
special administrative styles and managerial strategies to cope with them” (224). He also claims 
that the “inhabitants of small states […] remain intellectually dependent on larger states. They see 
themselves as miniature models of the larger nations and attempt to emulate them without fully 
realising that as small states they have an ecology of their own” (223). 
54. Many of the above problems have been identified for years. They have, for example, led to long-
running programmes within the Commonwealth to redress them supported by the Commonwealth 
Fund for Technical Co-operation, which currently disburses some 60% of its funds in favour of 
projects in Commonwealth small states. Bilateral donors have also been active in the Caribbean 
(UK and Canada) and the South Pacific (Australia and New Zealand) in support of public sector 
development, providing the basis for much of the higher per capita level of official development 
assistance small developing states receive compared to larger developing states. More generally, the 
need to ‘strengthen capacity’ in small states emerged as one of the four key themes to be promoted 
in the programme of action in favour of small states adopted by the World Bank in 2000. This 
included support by international financial institutions for the development of infrastructure and 
human capital (through education and training) as well as an emphasis on improved efficiency in 
the public services. Small states were also encouraged to build capacity by extending co-operation 
between states on a regional and sub-regional basis. The areas for potential co-operation included 
regulatory regimes (e.g. telecommunications); legal and judicial systems; education and health 
facilities; sharing investment codes; environmental regulations; and social security, tax and customs 
rules (Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank 2000: paragraphs 77-83).
23

C. Governance in the Caribbean
56. The importance of ‘good governance’ for economic and social development has been a major 
theme in development policy for the last ten years or so. The use of the word ‘good’ and the 
quotation marks that are frequently found around the concept of ‘good governance’ point to it 
having a high normative content and in consequence a number of differing definitions. The one 
cited in paragraph 14 draws on work by Kaufmann for the World Bank. There are, however, many 
others, and what is common to nearly all is the broad scope of the concept. Grindle, a leading 
academic researcher on the subject, neatly captures this in the following comment (2004):
“Getting good governance calls for improvements that touch virtually all aspects of the 
public sector – from institutions that set the rules of the game for economic and political 
interaction, to decision-making structures that determine priorities among public problems 
and allocate resources to respond to them, to organisations that manage administrative 
systems and deliver goods and services to citizens, to human resources that staff 
bureaucracies, to the interface of officials and citizens in political and bureaucratic arenas 
[…]. Not surprisingly, advocating good governance raises a host of questions about what 
needs to be done, when it needs to be done, and how it need to be done.”
57. In short, the breadth of the concept ensures there is little consensus on detail and application 
although there is broad agreement on what might be termed essential elements such as open, 
transparent and accountable government (often defined as liberal democracy); efficient, ef fective 
and responsive administration; respect for human rights; and the rule of law. There is also a growing 
understanding that “while it is possible to identify concepts and principles of governance that are 
universal, they make no sense without adequate contextual references. The particular conditions 
of each country provide both constraints and opportunities to improve governance.” (ODI: 2006). 
In practice, this has meant an approach to ‘good governance’ that increasingly begins from the 
existing realities of the state (or region) and then builds appropriate programmes in accordance 
with whether the state is, for example, a failed state, or one with pronounced personal rule, or is 
institutionalised minimally, or whatever. In the case of many small states, which possess significant 
attributes of democracy and a reasonably good record of public administration, this would suggest a 
radically different level and type of policy intervention than in a large sub-Saharan African country. 
Unfortunately, there is very little to report on small states qua small states since the overwhelming 
majority of them, and more especially islands, have not been subject to systematic programmes to 
build ‘good governance’ precisely because of their comparatively favourable record. There is, in 
consequence, next to nothing written on ‘good governance’ in small states in a general sense.
58. This is not to suggest, however, that small states may not have serious problems in sustaining 
‘good governance’. In a submission to the Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank Joint Task Force 
on Small States, CARICOM argued: “the costs of poor governance in a small society is very large, 
given the extreme difficulty in recovering from the consequences of inappropriate policies and 
practices sustained over a very long period. There is thus a clear need to build a national consensus 
on objectives; clear need for a national appreciation for the ease with which the system can go off-
track, as a result of both domestic and external shocks; and a broad acceptance that the prospects for 
every individual are intimately bound up with the future of the community as a whole” (CARICOM 
2000). The record of many small states in sub-Saharan Africa and more recently in the Pacific 
has also raised a number of serious and growing, if for the South Pacific sometimes exaggerated, 
25

(CGCED) which discussed governance at its meeting in June 2000. This considered several 
papers including a general paper on governance in the Caribbean (including non-Commonwealth 
Caribbean countries) which examined the subject under five headings: voice and participation 
(civil liberties, political rights, elections); rule of law; political instability and political violence; 
government effectiveness (the quality of public service provision); and graft (corruption) (Dollar 
2000). The countries scoring consistently above the average in all five indicators (and not all 
countries were included in every indicator) were the Bahamas and Trinidad & Tobago and the one 
consistently below average was Haiti. The study found that while the five indicators were positively 
correlated, the association among them was not high so countries could be strong in some areas of 
governance but weak in others. For example, Cuba scored above average in three out of five, the 
Dominican Republic and Guyana below average in three out of five, and Jamaica and Suriname 
below average in four out of five.  It concluded that while “Caribbean countries compare favourably 
to other developing countries and to Latin American countries in terms of governance and the rule 
of law […] that average finding disguises the fact that there is great variation among Caribbean 
states. It is not accurate to lump the different Caribbean countries together”. It also concluded 
that since the correlation among the five elements was weak “it is important to be clear about 
what aspect of governance one is talking about in making assessments of countries’ strengths and 
weaknesses” (Dollar 2000: 2). 
63. The period since then has seen a continuing concern with governance issues with academic 
conferences organised by the University of the West Indies and a meeting of the OAS Unit for the 
Promotion of Democracy in Barbados in 2002. The tone of the debate, however, has changed. The 
discussion is now more measured and more focused. This is exempliefi d in a paper presented by 
Selwyn Ryan to a UNDP conference of donors in Jamaica in 2002. In it Ryan reports on surveys 
on attitudes to governance conducted in 2001 in the OECS and in 2000 in Guyana and Trinidad & 
Tobago. In the individual members of the OECS he found “there was widespread dissatisfaction with 
the way the governments were running the country” with “a majority or near majority” believing the 
system of government could be “improved quite a lot” (Ryan 2002: 4-5). At the same time “people 
were more satisefi d (47%) than dissatisefi d (39%) with the way democracy worked in their respective 
countries” and they were also more “happy” with their general life situations (78%) than “unhappy” 
(8%). While these gfi ures clearly show there was room for improvement in governance, the general 
feeling of ‘well-being’ tempered any move to immediate drastic action and a substantial minority 
(31%) believed the system “worked well” even if there was room for minor improvement.
64. A not too dissimilar, if also more complex, picture emerges in Trinidad & Tobago and Guyana 
where race and ethnicity, as well as government incumbency, play a part in determining attitudes to 
governance. In Trinidad & Tobago, while a majority (52%) are dissatisfied with the way democracy 
works, a slightly larger majority (56%) believe they have good economic prospects in the future. 
Similarly, while the government is trusted by only a minority (47%), a majority (63%) believe they 
can use their vote to change the government. These figures suggest there is still a residual belief 
in the benefits of the system as a whole. This is not as true in Guyana where the racial and ethnic 
divide has significantly alienated the Afro-Guyanese. Levels of trust and distrust in the government 
reflect this with 69% of the Indo-Guyanese showing a high level of trust in the Indo-Guyanese 
dominated government but only 28% of Afro-Guyanese doing so. Similar findings are reported on 
hopes for the future with more Indo-Guyanese being optimistic (50%) than Afro-Guyanese (37%). 
Not surprisingly the Afro-Guyanese were in consequence more ready to contemplate migration  
(57%) than Indo-Guyanese (47%) although the high figures for both indicate a low general score of 
confidence in their country (Ryan 2002: 9-25).
27

69. By way of conclusion, while the Commonwealth Caribbean boasts a good record of democracy, 
there is a growing awareness that a reasonable functioning of the democratic system does 
not necessarily imply ‘good governance’. Within CARICOM and in the broader institutional 
framework of the Commonwealth, there is a remarkably open debate about the shortcomings of 
the political system and threats to ‘good governance’ in the region. The solutions advanced are 
mainly incremental: there is no widespread feeling that regime change is necessary to promote 
‘good governance’. Both democracy and ‘good governance’ have gone through rough times in the 
former Dutch colony of Suriname. After the return to democracy, the issue of ‘good governance’ 
has attained an increasing significance in the agenda of Dutch-Surinamese relations. At the same 
time the country’s membership of CARICOM provides an extra alert to the significance of ‘good 
governance’ (e.g. in the increasing use of CARICOM observer teams to monitor general elections) 
and perhaps an insight in best practices to promote it.
British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean 
70. The UK retains responsibility for fourteen overseas territories (BOTs), five of which are in 
the Caribbean (Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat and Turks & Caicos 
Islands). Bermuda, located in the North Atlantic, shares a similar history and is often grouped with 
them. While all are small (in physical size and population) they are, Montserrat excepted, relatively 
prosperous and Bermuda is currently said to have the highest per capita income in the world. 
71. In December 2003 the UK government launched a new Foreign and Commonwealth Office 
(FCO) Strategy focussing on eight international foreign policy priorities, one of which is security 
and good governance in the BOTs. This has given the BOTs a ‘higher profile’ than they would 
otherwise have within the government. The FCO is the main government department responsible 
for the BOTs and it co-ordinates policy toward them through a Ministerial Liaison Committee with 
the Department for International Development (DFID) and other government departments with an 
interest in them – the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Transport.
72. The FCO maintains an Overseas Territory Department in London which deals exclusively 
with the BOTS. There are around 70 staff (half being employed within the BOTs as Governors or 
administrators and support staff) plus some advisers and a few specialist staff in other ministries. 
The Caribbean Overseas Territories are covered by around fifteen staff in the FCO, 4/5 staff 
(including Governors) in each territory, supported by officials specialising in security issues (in 
Miami) and financial issues (in Barbados).
73. The principles and strategy for the government and development of the BOTs was set out in 
a White Paper in March 1999 entitled Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the 
Overseas Territories (Command 4264). This was the outcome of a major review of the overseas 
territories initiated by the ‘New Labour’ government shortly after taking office. The main objective 
of the White Paper was to ‘modernise’ the relationship with the BOTs. It established for the first 
time a Minister within the FCO with special responsibilities for the BOTs (this is not an exclusive 
responsibility since the Minister covers other regions and subjects) and an Overseas Territories 
Consultative Council composed of the elected Chief Minister (or equivalent) which meets annually 
in London under the chairmanship of the UK Minister for the BOTs. In addition, the Governors (or 
administrators) of each territory meet annually in London to review their experiences.
74. The core principle of the White Paper is the idea of ‘partnership’. This involves commitments 
by both the UK government and by the individual BOTs. The UK government reiterated its 
commitment to the BOTs and to the international community in respect of ensuring good 
29

78. The issues of ‘contingent liabilities’ and ‘moral hazard’ show how difficult it is in practice to 
“maintain a balance in the constitutional relationship, which reflects the rights and responsibilities 
of both the UK and the Overseas Territories”, which is one of the stated aims of the FCO Strategy 
(FCO website: UK Overseas Territories). The issue was very starkly put from the overseas 
territories perspective by Peter Caruana, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, in an address to the Wilton 
Park conference which discussed the BOTs in April 2000. He acknowledged, in the language of 
the White Paper, that the “partnership” imposes “obligation and responsibilities on both sides” and 
accepted the right of the UK to demand and insist on “good government”. But he also warned that:
“It would not be acceptable that the phrase “good government” should become a “catch 
all” concept by which Her Majesty’s Government (HMG) should seek to impose its own 
policies, views and cultural and ideological values on Overseas Territory governments. 
This would negate real democracy (since Overseas Territory citizens do not vote for the 
election of UK Governments or are represented in the UK Parliament) and would seriously 
erode our self-government in practice. Democratically elected Governments in the Overseas 
Territories are elected to implement and account to the electorate for their own policies, for 
the economic and social advancement of their country and not the policies of HMG in the 
UK, which are invariably and understandably designed and intended to promote the interests 
of the UK, which may be and indeed often are different. Self-government is not self-
government if it is subject to the views and approval of HMG.” (Caruana 2000).
79. He also acknowledged, again using the language of the White Paper, that the UK should seek 
“to minimise the extent” to which it was “exposed to contingent liabilities” and “readily accepted 
that the UK is entitled to insist on Overseas Territories complying with internationally legally 
binding obligations contracted by HMG on our behalf”. But he also noted:
“this begs another question. In a modern partnership said to be based on consultation 
and mutual understanding, should the UK enter into international commitments and 
obligations which bind Overseas Territories without the express consent of the Government 
of the territories? I believe that it should not! Often those international commitments 
impose a heavy financial or social burden on the territory. Indeed, often they undermine 
our economies. Contracting them on our behalf, and without our consent, in areas that 
are domestic in nature, is not consistent with self-government. If HMG is capable of 
converting domestic, internal affairs (which are the responsibility of Overseas Territories’ 
Governments) into external affairs simply by making them the subject of an international 
treaty obligation, that too is inconsistent with self-government” (Caruana 2000).
80. These are important questions that were not resolved in the White Paper. Indeed, they have 
become, if anything, more acute as a consequence of it. They have reappeared time and again in 
the discussion and application of ‘good governance’ in the BOTs exposing conflicts of interest and 
misunderstandings on both sides.
Good Governance in the Caribbean Overseas Territories
81. Some of the key features for ‘good governance’ in the BOTs were set out shortly after the 
publication of the White Paper. They included, in the words of the Under-Secretary of State 
Baroness Symons (1999):
“measures promoting more open, transparent and accountable government” (e.g. access to 
information, public engagement with debates in the legislature, the publication of debates 
31

85. The UK White Paper envisaged a process of constitutional modernisation to be, for the first 
time, initiated and led by the territorial governments. In practice, this has not delivered the early 
reform that was expected. While constitutional commissions have been appointed and have 
now reported in all territories, the protracted process of discussion within the territories and 
with London on the reports and on constitutional ‘advance’ point to a lack of enthusiasm for 
constitutional change in many of them. As such, only the TCI have completed the process and the 
results there show only minimal ‘advance’ (see Table Seven).  The UK government has made it 
plain on a number of occasions that it will play an important part in any process of constitutional 
modernisation, pointing out that “there must be full consideration and consultation across political 
parties, and the community as a whole, as well as with HMG” (Scotland 2000a) and that “once 
completed, there must be consultation with us. We have to retain reserved powers. We also need 
to protect key values, such as the impartiality of the civil service (including the police) and the 
independence of the judiciary” (Rammell 2003). The recently concluded negotiations on the new 
constitution with the TCI point to the ‘red lines’ beyond which the UK will not go in granting 
increased self government – powers will be retained in the UK (and for the Governor) to “ensure 
the implementation of international obligations; to protect itself against contingent liabilities; and to 
ensure good governance” (Triesman 2006).
86. The Governor: The Governor is appointed by the UK government, usually for a period of three 
years. Traditionally, the post has been occupied by an experienced diplomat from the FCO as a final 
post before retirement, although this pattern has begun to change in recent years. It can be a very 
challenging position. In her opening remarks to the Governor’s Conference in May 2000, Baroness 
Scotland stated: “I know only too well what a difficult role you play . Often characterised as being 
between the rock of the FCO and a hard place of local political leaderships, being a Governor is 
no ordinary political task. It is far more daunting, far more directly responsible, far lonelier than 
any Ambassadorship” (Scotland 2000b). It is also a post with ‘divided’ responsibilities: to the UK 
government for ensuring the various objectives defined immediately above are fulfilled, but also 
to the people of the territory to ensure their ‘best interests’ are represented to the FCO and the 
government in London and, if necessary, to their own locally elected government. 
87. The powers of the Governor are set out in the constitutions. They are least in Bermuda (and 
Montserrat) and relatively greater in the others where he/she has executive powers and reserved 
legislative powers. Typically the responsibilities include external affairs, defence, internal security 
(including the police), the public service (particularly senior appointments), and in several some 
financial oversight duties (Table Seven).  He/she is also the chair of the Executive Council. Not 
surprisingly, these powers have come under attack from elected Chief Ministers who have sought 
to reduce them as part of the ‘modernisation’ process. They have been resisted by the FCO. For 
example, in his speech to the Consultative Council in 2003, Bill Rammell rejected demands 
that Governors should not chair the Executive Council on the grounds that “Governors should 
be involved at an early stage in the decision making process”. He also argued that they needed 
to retain responsibility for the public service (Rammell 2003). More generally, the FCO has 
insisted throughout the ‘modernisation’ process that the Governors remain the main channel of 
communication between the FCO and the territory government, giving them a ‘pivotal’ role in the 
relationship and a unique insight of the various interests involved.
88. While the Governor does have considerable ‘independent’ powers, he/she has the duty to 
consult and take advice from the executive council and is bound by ‘collective responsibility’ to 
it. The extent to which this will then shape their actions depends on personality and on the issue 
in question. It is here that ‘small size’ makes a difference. As noted earlier, small size exaggerates 
the role of personality in politics. In the Caribbean territories there are two ‘chief executives’: the 
33

D. Implications for the Kingdom of the Netherlands
91. The Netherlands Antilles and Aruba are small and have a unique position even among the 
disparate collection of small states, island states and/or non-sovereign (island) jurisdictions 
worldwide. In addition, the linguistic barrier has worked to keep these six islands, as well as the 
overarching structure of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, at the margins of the scholarly literature 
on decolonisation, small scale and good governance (for comparative purposes see Oostindie and 
Klinkers 2003, Oostindie 2006). Therefore, this section offers a reflection of the relevance of the 
previous review for the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba rather than an overview of the scholarly 
literature. 
92. A second preliminary observation is that all of the six Caribbean islands of the Kingdom should 
be qualified as extremely small even within the entire category of small states and territories as 
discussed in this paper. Added together, with well over 300,000 inhabitants, the six would qualify 
as one of the more populated non-independent territories (Table 2) and, by way of comparison, 
somewhere in the middle brackets of the category of sovereign small states (Table 1). Yet Aruba 
has already seceded from the Netherlands Antilles and a further dismantlement of the multi-
island country is presently in the making. Curaçao would then fall somewhere in between the two 
categories of ‘mini’ and ‘micro’, as Aruba already does. The four remaining islands would have to 
be qualified as ‘micro’, St. Maarten possibly qualifying as an average micro territory , but Bonaire, 
St. Eustatius and Saba at the extreme pole of smallness.
93. This observation is crucial and almost serves as a disclaimer. For while this paper discusses a 
broad range of studies on smallness and its consequences for good governance, the great majority 
of these actually focus on states and non-sovereign territories with considerable higher population 
figures. Some of the more optimistic conclusions on the relation – or lack thereof – between 
smallness and quality of governance may therefore not be fully applicable to the Dutch Caribbean 
islands treated as separate units. If vulnerability increases with small scale and therefore heightens 
the need for ‘good governance’ to strengthen resilience, than these six individual islands are clearly 
in need of policies aiming to achieve and sustain good governance.  
94. The Dutch Caribbean islands all benefit from their non-sovereign status. For while vulnerability 
is characteristic of small states in general, non-sovereignty is apparently an asset enhancing 
resilience and providing better conditions for promoting economic development. The tendency 
discerned in the economics literature that levels of income in the metropolis and its dependencies 
tend to convergence does not apply to all of the Dutch Caribbean islands. It is evident though that 
standard of living in the Dutch parts of the Caribbean too is well above the regional average for 
sovereign states (Tables 1 and 2).
95. Research on the relationship between small scale, democracy and good governance has shown 
that there is no real evidence to identify small scale as a disadvantage per se. Indeed, the evidence 
suggests that smallness may be more of a stimulus than an obstacle to democracy in sovereign 
states. This may partly be explained by inherited (post)colonial democratic traditions. In this 
respect, it seems more than coincidental that the majority of small states and territories worldwide 
have British antecedents. If the British apparently left a useful political and legal tradition for small 
states to draw on, there is the painful Dutch Caribbean counterpoint of Suriname. For this republic, 
sovereignty has implied very serious problems with both democracy and good governance. 
35

101. The political process in small developing countries has been characterised under the headings 
of ‘exaggerated personalism’, ‘governmental pervasiveness’, ‘concerted social harmony’, and 
‘pragmatic conservatism’. These characteristics arguably apply to the Netherlands Antilles and 
Aruba as well and will actually be accentuated after the dismantlement of the present multi-island 
jurisdiction of the Antilles. Perhaps ‘concerted social harmony’ will become a stronger and more 
constructive power in the individual islands after the break-up of the Antilles. At present, pessimism 
on social bonding in these islands seems to be dominant particularly on the three larger islands, 
where both heavy migration and drugs-related criminality exact a heavy toll. The problems for good 
governance identified under the remaining three characteristics will most likely be compounded. 
This will demand solid measures to improve the quality of governance.  
102. There is an ongoing and remarkably open debate about the quality of governance and civil 
society in the Commonwealth Caribbean. Many of the observations in these debates might well be 
taken to apply to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba as well. Among the measures taken to promote 
‘good governance’ within the Commonwealth Caribbean are schemes for training and cooperation 
with other Commonwealth countries. This seems to be a healthy antidote to a lingering dominance 
of bilateral postcolonial relations with all the inevitable tensions arising from it. In this perspective 
not only the post-independence Surinamese-Dutch relations suffer from exclusive bilateralism, but 
so and even more do Caribbean-Dutch relations within the Kingdom. Unfortunately, the room for 
diversification is limited here because of constitutional and administrative distinctiveness as well as 
linguistic constraints.
103. The most obvious comparison for the Kingdom of the Netherlands is the one with Britain’s 
relationship to the Caribbean BOTs. Here we may observe strong parallels in the debates over 
promoting effective and efficient administration in all of these non-sovereign territories and 
the need to promote better governance. There are similar strong parallels when it comes to the 
metropolitan resolution to reserve ultimate administrative powers to itself and even to reassert 
its primacy in view of what the British have identified as ‘contingent liabilities’ and international 
commitments. The one major difference here may be that the British, in setting clear limits to self-
rule in the BOTs, are simply confirming their own supremacy, whereas the Dutch in their policy 
of the past fifteen years or so of strengthening the powers of the Dutch-controlled Kingdom are 
seeking to constrain the autonomy extended to their Caribbean partners in 1954.
104. A final word on the transparency of the two postcolonial working relationships may be in 
order. The British model, while certainly more hegemonic and probably more authoritarian than the 
Kingdom’s, does have the advantage of being relatively transparent and relatively simply. There 
is a modest Caribbean division within the FCO, a governor and a small local staff in each of the 
Caribbean BOTs, and a locally elected administration with its own bureaucracy. The contrast with 
the Kingdom’s institutions as established in 1954 and developed since then are stark. The Kingdom 
has a Queen and a Kingdom Cabinet (but no Kingdom parliament) as well as two governors, 
presently one for the Netherlands Antilles and one for Aruba. The governor has a double function, 
as he serves at the same time as head of the local government. In addition, the Dutch government 
has its own directorate for Kingdom relations in the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom relations 
in The Hague, with representative offices in Aruba, Curacao and St. Maarten. The Netherlands 
Antilles and Aruba have a locally elected parliament and cabinet – and, for the present Antilles, 
representative councils on all five islands – as well as a Ministers Plenipotentiary stationed in The 
Hague. Finally, a trilateral committee of parliamentarians meets twice a year, alternating between 
The Hague and the Dutch Caribbean islands. In all, this seems to be a very complex administrative 
structure with many opportunities for administrative confusion and policy conflict to the detriment 
of effective, efficient, transparent and accountable governance.

territories and therefore of most relevance to this study, and the mostly larger non-Commonwealth 
states. The former hold much in common in respect of governance while the latter do not. 
111. The record shows that on the whole the Commonwealth Caribbean (including the British 
Overseas Territories) have better than average levels of good governance. They also have robust 
democracies. As noted earlier, some distinguished academics have found this surprising given 
the violent colonial history that has shaped the region. But the literature suggests that there 
have also been more ‘benign’ legacies, one among which, for small states in general and for 
the Commonwealth Caribbean in particular, has been the model of parliamentary government 
bequeathed by the British. The fact that this has been essentially ‘unmodified’ and ‘unchallenged’ 
in nearly all the states and non-independent territories in the last forty years or so shows that it 
is generally regarded as ‘fit for purpose’, with the result that there is little appetite for change 
– especially in the British Overseas Territories. 
112. At the same time, there is gathering recognition of some need for incremental change if the 
current situation is to be maintained and ‘good governance’ assured in the future. The argument is 
about how much change and in what direction? There is little agreement on these questions among 
the independent Commonwealth Caribbean states and hence, at best, only slow movement. By 
contrast, the arguments in the British Overseas Territories are more focused as a consequence of 
the recent ‘modernisation’ of the relationship between them and the UK government. But even here 
there is recognition of the need to proceed slowly (if at all) and to take into account the differences 
between the territories. 
113. In sum, the states and non-independent territories of the Commonwealth Caribbean share 
a common colonial and post-colonial experience that has given them a “distinct tradition” in 
which “there is an emphasis upon continuities in the political process and acceptance rather than 
rejection of the metropolitan legacy” (Sutton 1991: 51). This means two things. First, insofar as 
their experience is ‘distinct’ it is, by definition, an experience that is not readily transferable to 
others. Second, since this has led them to accept their governance structures largely unreformed it 
means that the arguments and debate on ‘good governance’ in the region is relatively undeveloped 
(in relation to some other regions of the developing world) and remains relatively narrow in its 
policy focus. The debate on governance in the region has therefore been engaged but is not yet at a 
sufficiently advanced level to enable robust conclusions (as opposed to diagnostic generalities) to be 
reached.
114. The response to the third question – what type of governmental institutions and services are 
particularly vulnerable in small countries? – is also limited by a relative lack of research and debate 
as noted in paragraphs 13 and 57. It is also subject to the observation in paragraph 22 that the 
experience of regime change in small states since independence does not specify a specific generic 
regime type but rather leaves options open, although there is some evidence that parliamentary 
systems are especially suitable for them. As such, it is almost impossible to be precise. 
115. We do know that small size acts as a constraint on the effective delivery of government 
services and that it is necessary to guard against the twin dangers of ‘exaggerated personalism’ 
and governmental pervasiveness’ in the creation of institutions and the conduct of government and 
administration. But at what level of size this makes a real difference (e.g. above or below a specific 
per capita income, a specific population size, or a specific land area – or more likely a combination 
of all three) we do not know, as the early abandonment of the categories of micro-state and mini-
state so clearly demonstrates. Similar qualifications attach to the question of ‘islandness’ which 
may, or may not, act as a support. 
39

120. Nevertheless, there are some points that can be taken from the experience of the 
Commonwealth Caribbean. The regional dimension is here particularly significant since it has 
provided support for ‘good governance’ in a number of ways. In 1990 the Heads of Government 
of CARICOM issued the Kingston Declaration on Democracy and Popular Participation and more 
importantly in 1997 adopted a Charter for Civil Society to encourage and empower civil society 
and to foster good practice among member states. A similar profile has supported regional efforts 
to improve public administration. The Heads of Government approved a programme of public 
sector reform and administrative restructuring in 1995 to be implemented through national and 
regional efforts with the support and encouragement of the Caribbean Centre for Development 
Administration, which was specifically charged with spreading good practice throughout the region.     
121. The Commonwealth Caribbean has also directly benefited from support from the 
Commonwealth Secretariat based in London. The Commonwealth defines 32 of its 53 members 
as small states and the Secretariat has run programmes in support of ‘good governance’ for many 
years. These range from the use of the Commonwealth Secretary General’s ‘good offices’ to settle 
sensitive ‘internal’ conflicts in member states, through initiatives which support and encourage 
‘good governance’ through publications and meetings to disseminate good practice, to targeted 
programmes in support of public administration such as regular meetings of electoral officers, 
judicial officers and public officials providing the whole range of government services.  Together 
these provide an invaluable inventory of ‘good practices’ which can inform and help embed ‘good 
governance’ in a variety of otherwise dissimilar small states. More generally, the Commonwealth 
has also supported a website on small states through which innovatory ‘good practice’ can be 
shared.
122. In conclusion, the literature on small states and the experience of the Commonwealth 
Caribbean (independent and non-independent) provide insights into building states and fostering 
‘good governance’, but they do not provide templates. It is important to be aware of what has been 
important to them. But even more important is the need to be aware of the unique history, traditions 
and (increasingly small) scale of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba, along with their unique 
international status, in creating new institutions for their future.
123. From this perspective, it may be useful for all engaged in the present debate on the 
restructuring of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to reflect on the following: if indeed, as many seem 
to think, governance on the islands does not clearly qualify as ‘good’, this may well be attributed to 
the lack of a solid administrative tradition and infrastructure. But this only begs the next question: 
should this be attributed to an inadequate, perhaps overly complex institutional structure (i.e. the 
structure and functions of the institutions), or to the poor use made of them (i.e. the political process 
itself). If it is the former, then institutional change will help deliver ‘good governance’, but if it is 
the latter then more fundamental changes of the political culture will be needed and these take a 
long time, sometimes generations, to achieve.
