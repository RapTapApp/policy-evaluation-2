4. OTEC, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, is a new technology using the 
temperature difference between ocean surface water (27 – 29 degrees Celsius) and 
the temperatures at approx. 1,000 meters deep, 5 degrees Celsius. This system 
requires a large diameter cold sea water pipe to a depth of 1,000 meters, several 
kilometers long, large heat exchangers, pumps and turbines to produce electricity. 
OTEC can also provide fresh water and cold seawater for cooling purposes. It can 
be applied on all three BES islands.  
 
5. Geothermal energy: research in the past has shown that there is a 21% chance that 
Saba can develop geothermal energy for its power generation. The potential could 
be very large, however, Saba has a very limited electricity demand. Studies have 
shown that a connection with St. Maarten, requiring a long sea cable for electricity 
transportation, could result in attractively low electricity costs. The risks of 
geothermal energy exploration and development however, are high. Regional 
development is increasing and should be watched.  
 
6. Other renewable energy sources like biomass and biofuels, waste to energy, wave 
and tidal energy a/o are not available on the islands and are not expected to be able 
to contribute to electricity generation for the coming 15 years. 
 
Energy efficiency may also contribute in reducing energy costs of the islands. 
Unfortunately, no information was available on the energy consumption in different 
sectors, penetration of specific energy consuming appliances and quality of housing and 
other buildings.

and geothermal energy do not need back up for electricity generation. It is also expected 
that now or quickly available renewable energy sources will have reached their lifetime and 
will be dismantled at the time OTEC or geothermal energy will have been developed and 
implemented. 
 
For each of these scenarios a kWh-cost has been calculated for the additional renewable 
electricity generation, which has been compared to the fuel costs of conventional electricity 
production with the diesel generators as the alternative option. In case this kWh-cost is 
lower than the fuel costs, this scenario will result in reduced overall electricity costs. The 
results of this comparison are shown in the below graphs. The kWh costs have been 
calculated using three interest rates: 4% with Dutch financing support or guarantees; 10% 
based on almost fully commercial financing, and an intermediate rate of 7%. 
 
 
The fuel prices applied are based on world oil market developments: 
 
WTI crude oil price  (per bbl) US$ 50 US$ 90 US$ 130 
HFO US$ 0.51 US$ 0.91 US$ 1.32 
LFO US$ 0.73 US$ 1.32 US& 1.90 
 
These fuel cost prices have been used to compare the kWh-generation costs of the 
renewable electricity generation with the fuel costs of conventional, diesel power 
generation. 
 
 
For Bonaire, Decentral scenario 1, 
extension of solar and wind power up 
to 50% of electricity generation, 
comes close to the current fuel costs. 
All scenarios will result in an increase 
of kWh costs when the fuel price is 
low. At the medium fuel price, 
Decentral scenarios 1 will help in 
keeping the kWh costs at approx. the 
same level. The relatively small effect 
of increased renewables is primarily a 
result of the lower fuel price at Bonaire. OTEC is too expensive at the current estimates of 
investment costs. Further development and experience is required to effectively exploit this 
renewable energy source. This potentially attractive option needs to be monitored closely. 
 
When developing renewable energy at utility scale, 80% renewable electricity can be 
reached applying more wind, which has a better capacity factor and lower kWh-costs. With 
8.1 MW wind, 60% of renewable electricity generation can be reached without adding solar 
1
power or storage for reducing curtailment . The 81% scenario increases wind up to 10.9 
MW (additional to the already installed 11.1 MW) with 10 MW of solar PV. 
 
For St. Eustatius and Saba the results for scenarios 1 and 2 are similar. Only at a medium 
fuel price the renewables will contribute to lower kWh costs, especially when the interest 
rates for financing of the facilities is 7% or less. Wind power is less attractive on these 
islands compared to Bonaire with very favorable wind conditions. Scenario 3 for Saba, 
geothermal energy is a real interesting option, however with important technological risks.

 The storage capacity in the tables relates to storage for energy shifting, reducing the amount of curtailment and thus 
increasing the renewable harvest. Storage for ramp rate control has only been addressed via investment mark-ups, as these 
need to be assessed in more detail from a financial and technical standpoint.

Conclusions and recommendations: 
 
At current levels of fuel prices, extension of the share of renewable energy at the CN islands 
will only result in reducing kWh costs when the investments can be financed at (very) low 
interest rates. Other scenarios can be developed when world oil prices, and thus the fuel 
prices, will increase. Feasibility and development studies will be required to ensure that all 
costs will be taken into account before entering into development and realization.  
 
Energy efficiency has not been addressed but could certainly contribute to reducing 
electricity demand and thus fuel usage and imports. A practical study on energy 
consumption in the main economic sectors (households; commercial; industrial; tourism; 
offices; retail) should be implemented. 
 
From the above, we identified the following recommendations: 
 
1. Initiate integral feasibility studies for the realization of wind power on Saba and St. 
Eustatius. As solar power is now being implemented, the most feasible option to 
further realize sustainable electricity generation is through wind power. Main issue 
will be to identify suitable locations (wind speed; visibility and noise aspects; 
resistance among inhabitants; cost assessment for site preparation, grid connection 
and infrastructure development) and associated cost elements; 
2. Prepare and implement a feasibility study for OTEC on Bonaire. Bonaire seems to 
have a relatively attractive coastline and access to deep sea. Bonaire can realize a 
larger scale installation than the other islands and may combine electricity 
generation with the provision of cooling and fresh water production.  
3. Prepare and conduct an exploration study for geothermal energy for Saba, to be 
executed by a regionally operating geothermal company, related to other projects 
developed in the Caribbean. Although Saba has a very small electricity demand, 
geothermal power generation could be a feasible option, depending on the 
development costs and financing options. Providing electricity for St. Maarten should 
be part of the study as this could reduce the electricity generation costs for both 
islands considerably; 
4. Investigate how a financial scheme, with a sufficiently attractive feed-in tariff 
together with a cost per kW installed to cover for additional balancing costs by WEB 
or CGB, could be developed for the stimulation of decentralized renewable energy 
generation at CN.

4. OTEC, Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, is een nieuwe technologie die het 
temperatuurverschil tussen het oppervlaktewater van de oceaan (27 – 29 graden 
Celsius) en de watertemperatuur op ca. 1.000 meter diepte (ca. 5 graden Celsius) 
gebruikt om elektriciteit op te wekken. Met een 5 tot 8 km lange pijp met een 
diameter van enige meters wordt koud zeewater opgepompt. Met een grote 
warmtewisselaar, pompen en turbines kan dan elektriciteit worden geproduceerd. 
OTEC kan ook zoet water leveren en koud water voor koeling. OTEC kan in principe 
op alle drie de eilanden worden ingezet.  
 
5. Geothermische energie: eerder onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat er een redelijke 
kans van 21% is dat op Saba geothermische energie kan worden ontwikkeld voor 
elektriciteitsopwekking. Het potentieel zou groot kunnen zijn, maar Saba heeft 
slechts een kleine energievraag. Studies hebben laten zien dat een koppeling met 
St. Maarten, waarvoor een lange, onderzeese elektriciteitskabel nodig is met 
eveneens hoge kosten, in aanzienlijk lagere opwekkingskosten kan resulteren. De 
risico’s bij de ontwikkeling van geothermie zijn echter hoog. Op verschillende andere 
Caribische eilanden vinden ontwikkelingen op dit gebied plaats die nauwlettend 
gevolgd dienen te worden.  
 
6. Andere duurzame energiebronnen zoals biomassa en biobrandstoffen, energie uit 
afval, golf en getijde-energie e.a. zijn niet beschikbaar op de eilanden. Ook wordt 
niet verwacht dat die de komende 15 jaar beschikbaar zullen zijn voor 
elektriciteitsproductie op de CN eilanden. 
 
Energiebesparing kan ook bijdragen aan vermindering van de energielasten voor burgers 
en bedrijven op deze eilanden. Helaas is geen informatie beschikbaar over het 
elektriciteitsverbruik in verschillende sectoren of in huishoudens, over de penetratiegraad 
van energie verbruikende apparaten of over de kwaliteit van huizen en andere gebouwen.

De brandstofbesparingen in Scenario 3 zijn berekend vergeleken met de situatie dat er 
verder geen duurzame energie wordt opgewekt, dus alsof de gehele elektriciteitsvraag met 
dieselgeneratoren zou worden opgewekt. OTEC en geothermie hebben in beginsel geen 
back up nodig. Ook is aangenomen dat alle nu reeds geïnstalleerde duurzame opwekking 
technisch en economisch afgeschreven zal zijn op het moment dat OTEC en/of geothermie 
daadwerkelijk gerealiseerd zullen gaan worden. 
 
Voor ieder van de scenario’s zijn de kWh-kosten berekend van de extra duurzame 
elektriciteitsopwekking. Deze zijn vergeleken met de brandstofkosten van conventionele 
opwekking met dieselgeneratoren als het alternatief. In het geval dat deze kWh-kosten lager 
zijn dan de brandstofkosten, dan resulteert dit scenario in lagere kWh-kosten in de 
elektriciteitsvoorziening. De resultaten van deze vergelijking zijn weergegeven in 
onderstaande staafdiagrammen. De kWh-kosten zijn berekend voor drie verschillende 
rentetarieven: 4% met financieringshulp of garanties, 10% met commerciële financiering en 
7% als een tussenliggend tarief. 
 
De gehanteerd brandstofprijzen zijn direct gerelateerd aan ontwikkelingen op de 
wereldoliemarkt: 
 
WTI ruwe olieprijs  (per barrel) 
$ 50 $ 90 $ 130 
Brandstof: 
HFO $ 0,51 $ 0,91 $ 1,32 
LFO $ 0,73 $ 1,32 & 1,90 
 
De hierboven gegeven brandstofprijzen zijn gebruikt om de kWh-opwekkingskosten door 
de duurzame energieopwekking te vergelijken met de brandstofkosten van conventionele, 
met dieselgeneratoren, opgewekte elektriciteit. 
 
 
Voor Bonaire komt de uitbreiding van 
zon- en windenergie tot 50% 
elektriciteitsopwekking in het 
decentrale scenario 1, dicht bij de 
brandstofkosten voor conventionele 
opwekking. Alle scenario’s resulteren 
in hogere opwekkingskosten wanneer 
de brandstofprijzen laag zijn. Het 
decentrale scenario 1 helpt dan om de 
kWh-kosten op hetzelfde niveau te 
houden. Het beperkte effect van een 
toename van hernieuwbare opwekking wordt vooral veroorzaakt doordat Bonaire een 
betrekkelijk lage brandstofprijs kent. OTEC is nog veel te duur bij de huidige schattingen 
van de investeringskosten. Verdere ontwikkeling en ervaring met deze techniek is vereist 
om hier echt gebruik van te kunnen gaan maken. De ontwikkelingen rond deze in principe 
aantrekkelijke optie dienen gevolgd te worden. 
 
Indien duurzame elektriciteitsopwekking op utiliteitsschaal kan worden ontwikkeld, kan een 
aandeel duurzaam van 80% worden bereikt door vooral wind toe te passen, die een hogere 
capaciteitsfactor heeft en mede daardoor lagere kWh-kosten. Met 8,1 MW wind, kan 60% 
duurzame elektriciteitsopwekking worden bereikt zonder extra zon of opslag voor 
2
vermindering van de outputbeperking . In het 80% scenario wordt 10,9 MW wind ingezet 
(extra t.o.v. de reeds geïnstalleerde 11,1 MW) met 10 MW zon PV.

 De weergeven opslagcapaciteit is bedoeld voor het opslaan van energie anders verloren was gegaan door een te hoge 
totale productie, om deze later weer vrij te geven. Opslagcapaciteit voor het compenseren van snelle 
outputdalingen/stijgingen is meegenomen in de investeringsbedragen middels ophoging aangezien dit nog financieel en 
technisch dient te worden geadresseerd.

Conclusies en aanbevelingen: 
 
Bij het huidige niveau van de brandstofprijzen draagt uitbreiding van het aandeel duurzame 
elektriciteitsopwekking alleen bij aan kWh-kosten vermindering indien de investeringen 
tegen een laag rentetarief kunnen worden gefinancierd. Andere scenario’s kunnen worden 
ontwikkeld als de olieprijzen en dus de brandstofprijzen voor de CN eilanden toenemen. 
Haalbaarheids- en ontwikkelingsstudies zullen nodig zijn om er zeker van te zijn dat met 
alle kosten rekening wordt gehouden voordat tot ontwikkeling of realisatie wordt 
overgegaan.  
 
Energiebesparing is niet verder behandeld maar zou zeker een bijdrage kunnen leveren 
aan vermindering van de elektriciteitsvraag en dus aan vermindering van brandstofverbruik 
en –import. Een praktijkstudie naar elektriciteitsverbruik in huishoudens en de belangrijkste 
sectoren van de economie (handel; industrie; toerisme; kantoren, winkels e.d.) zou 
uitgevoerd moeten worden om inzicht te krijgen in de meest effectieve maatregelen. 
 
Op basis van het voorgaande komen we tot de volgende aanbevelingen: 
 
1. Voer integrale haalbaarheidsstudies uit naar de realisatie van windenergie op Saba 
en St. Eustatius. Aangezien zonne-energie al wordt ontwikkeld dient voor verdere 
uitbreiding van duurzame elektriciteitsopwekking vooral naar wind te worden 
gekeken als de meest haalbare optie. Belangrijk aspect daarbij is het vinden van 
geschikte locaties (windsnelheid; geluid; visuele hinder; weerstand bewoners; locatie 
werkzaamheden; netaansluiting en infrastructuurverbetering) en andere 
gerelateerde kostenposten; 
2. Tref voorbereidingen voor en voer een haalbaarheidsstudie uit voor OTEC op 
Bonaire. Bonaire lijkt geschikte omstandigheden voor OTEC te hebben, kustlijn en 
toegang tot de diepzee. Op Bonaire kan een grootschaliger installatie worden 
gerealiseerd die met koeling en/of zoetwaterproductie kan worden gecombineerd;  
3. Tref voorbereidingen voor en laat een exploratiestudie voor geothermische energie 
op Saba uitvoeren, bij voorkeur uit te voeren door een bedrijf met ervaring in de regio. 
Alhoewel Saba een kleine elektriciteitsvraag heeft, zou geothermie een haalbare 
optie kunnen zijn, afhankelijk van de ontwikkelingskosten en financieringsopties. 
Levering van elektriciteit aan St. Maarten dient onderdeel van deze studie uit te 
maken, omdat hiermee de opwekkingskosten zouden kunnen worden verlaagd, voor 
beide eilanden; 
4. Onderzoek hoe een financiële regeling voor de CN eilanden voor de stimulering van 
decentrale duurzame energie kan worden ontwikkeld. Zo’n regeling met een

3. Analysis of the current electricity generation of the CN-islands together with 
development of possible scenarios, mixes of renewable energy technologies to 
realize the above shares of renewable electricity generation; 
4. Interviews with stakeholders on the CN-islands to discuss the island reports and 
suggestions for energy scenarios; 
5. Development of energy scenarios for the CN-islands reaching 60%, 80% and 100% 
of renewable electricity generation, including an investment and kWh-cost analysis 
and an assessment of CO2-emission reduction. 
 
The results of the study are presented in this report. Chapter 2 gives a summary of the most 
relevant renewable energy technologies. Chapter 3 presents the current electricity 
generation systems of the CN-islands. Chapter 4 presents the selected scenarios together 
with the results in terms of fuel use reductions, CO2 emission reduction, overall investment 
costs and kWh-costs. Chapter 5 provides conclusions and recommendations.

the sea. Technical and economic developments in these fields need to make significant 
progress before biofuels can be applied on the CN-islands. 
 
Hydro energy: 
Hydro energy is not available on the CN-islands. Economic application of hydro energy 
requires sufficient rainfall together with storage capacity at sufficient altitudes. Neither is 
present at these islands. In addition, development and implementation of hydro energy 
requires larger scale electricity systems than can be found at Bonaire, Saba or St. 
4
Eustatius . This is also the case for pumped hydro for storage of electrical energy which 
5
might become economically viable for systems larger than 100 MW storage capacities . 
 
2.1 Project management and cost overruns 
The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs witnessed severe cost overruns in many projects 
on the Caribbean Islands. Some are summarized in the table below. 
 
Realized and ongoing projects Cost overrun compared with first 
detailed cost estimate (%) 
New diesel and wind electricity generating plant Bonaire 54% 
Relocation of Saba power plant 169% 
New diesel generators for Saba 119% 
First St. Eustatius solar park 148% 
  
Projects that will be contracted shortly: Expected: 
Second solar park St. Eustatius 100% 
Saba solar park 150% 
Table 1: Cost overruns in energy projects in the Caribbean 
Therefore the Ministry requested to comment on these cost overruns and to take the 
reasons for such cost overruns into account when preparing cost assessments for the 
development and implementation of renewable energy projects on the CN-islands. 
 
Several leading financing organizations have examined the main reasons for extended 
schedules and cost overruns for larger infrastructure projects in developing countries. Their 
conclusions are summarized below. 
 
Large infrastructure projects are a particular kind of project characterized by their large size, 
high complexity, expensive budgets, and extended schedules compared to traditional 
construction projects. Most of these large projects exceed their estimated budget, fall 
behind schedule, and fail to meet the original project’s objectives. The causes for these 
problems have been well documented and can be summarized as follows:  
 
• Lack of realism in initial cost estimates; 
• Underestimation of length and cost of delays; 
• Under-evaluated quantities and price changes; 
• Contingencies are set too low; 
• Underestimated geological risks; 
• Undervaluation of expropriations costs and time; 
• Undervaluation of safety and environmental demands; 
• High risk as a result of technological innovation; 
• Changes in project specifications and design are not sufficiently taken into account.  
 
Causes of poor performance can be analyzed during the planning and execution phase, 
Haidar and Ellis (2010) identified these causes in each phase being the most relevant:

2.2 Wind energy 
 
The installed capacity of wind energy in the Caribbean is reported at 250MW by GWEC. It 
consists of wind farms in Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Cuba, Dominica, Guadalupe, Jamaica, 
Martinique, Granada, St. Kitts and Nevis. Wind energy thus can be regarded as an existing 
and viable renewable energy source in the Caribbean.  
 
There are many publications on wind power development in the Caribbean. However, most 
of these studies, articles and reports do not provide practical data on costs and benefits of 
7
electricity produced by wind turbines. Shirley & Kammen has been the only source of such 
information, additional to the documentation for the CN islands at hand. Wind turbine 
installation costs are estimated at $ 2.400/kW based upon the large 3MW each, 15MW in 
total wind parks built in Aruba and Curaçao. This is 50% to 70% higher than installation 
costs in the industrialized countries. It can be expected that smaller wind turbines of 1 MW 
will be even more expensive.  
 
8
The ECN report on Saba and St. Eustatius does not address the economic factors of wind 
energy such as the (normalized) costs per kW. The report does state that the favorable wind 
location on St. Eustatius is east of the Quill at a distance of 4 km from the nearest grid 
connection point. There is a substantial cost increase to be expected due to this grid 
extension. For Saba a location close to the harbor and thus close to the new power plant 
has been selected, which would most likely limit the grid connection costs. 
 
9
The KEMA 2011-2025 masterplan for Bonaire estimates the wind costs for Bonaire for 
smaller wind turbines at $ 2,700/kW (grid related costs excluded). This is considered to be 
the norm for all CN islands in this study as it is in line with aforementioned Shirley & Kammen 
study at a reasonable increased cost level for smaller turbines.  
 
Wind speeds vary substantially among the individual islands. Bonaire shows relatively high 
and constant wind speeds, just like its neighboring islands Curaçao and Aruba. Wind only 
diminishes during the September/October period due to increased hurricane activity in the 
Atlantic Ocean. St. Eustatius and Saba have two main wind climate seasons, the hurricane 
season from July till mid-December and the “trade wind“ season between mid-December 
and July. The following table shows the key parameters for the three individual islands 
based upon actual wind measurements.

2.3 Solar Energy 
 
As sunlight is abundant it is estimated that solar is the biggest renewable resource in the 
14
Caribbean according to a 2010 study of Nexant amongst many islands including Saba 
and St. Eustatius. By then however, solar PV was not regarded competitive as compared 
to wind, geothermal and conventional diesel generation. It must be said that from 2009 
onwards, global prices of solar panels dropped substantially, making solar far more 
competitive than before. 
 
15
The 2014 Castalia overview of renewables at CREF shows a totally different picture with 
the French islands Martinique and Guadeloupe leading the way with both >65MW solar PV 
connected to the grid. An increasing number of islands have either implemented or initiated 
solar projects. Just recently, the Jamaican Office of Utility Regulation (OUR) announced the 
16
outcome of a renewable tender including 33MW of solar energy . Solar PV has established 
a firm position in the energy production mix of many Caribbean islands. 
 
With regards to the Dutch Caribbean, Curaçao has the most extensive regime on solar, 
based upon a distributed model with currently approximately 1% (700) of its end-users with 
grid-tied solar installations with a total capacity of about 10MW. The regime includes 
17
permitting, inspections, feed-in and grid-connection tariffs. The energy regulator assumes 
a payback time of 8 years and adjusts the tariffs every year accordingly. The installation 
costs are estimated at $1.6-2.0/W ranging from small residential systems to 1MW size. 
Utility scale solar plants are not (yet) built as the utility company Aqualectra has given more 
priority to economically more favorable large-scale wind farms. 
 
Curaçao stimulates decentralized solar energy through its Policy Paper on Small Scale 
18
Sustainable Electricity Provision of 2011 . As part of this policy, Curaçao has set a series 
of feed-in tariffs for the supply of electricity to the grid by small-scale, decentralized PV-
installations. The following table shows this initial incentive scheme. 
 
Tariff group: Feed-in tariff  Fixed tariff per Feed-in tariff  Fixed tariff per 
until 1-1-2015 month  from 1-1-2016 month  
until 1-1-2015  from 1-1-2016 
19
Residential Net metering 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 8.95/kW 
Commercial $ 0.235/kWh 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 18.90/kW 
Industry standard $ 0.235/kWh 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 18.90/kW 
Industry export $ 0.235/kWh 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 8.95/kW 
Industry import $ 0.235/kWh 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 18.90/kW 
Hospitals $ 0.235/kWh 0 $ 0.14/kWh $ 8.95/kW 
Table 4: Curaçao scheme for decentralized PV-installations 
The system until 2015 resulted in a three-year payback time for residential PV installations 
causing a very fast increase of these installations. Due to its success, the incentive program 
resulted in potential increase of the regular tariffs. Therefore the scheme was modified as 
per January 2015 into a full net billing program with a fixed monthly fee per installed kW. 
The feed-in tariff is evaluated every year. The table shows the current tariffs as per January 
2016. 
 
20
Aruba’s electricity distribution company N.V. Elmar allows end-users to connect solar 
installations with limited capacity. A grid usage fee per installed kW applies as well as feed-

2.4 Energy storage 
 
2.4.1 Key elements of storage in small island electricity grids 
 
Small island electricity grids have a relatively low demand. When intermittent renewables 
like wind or solar are implemented, it will easily lift the renewable penetration to a substantial 
level as compared to the daily peak.  
It is generally accepted that penetration levels up to 20-25% can be reached without any 
additional measures to be taken. Above that level, measures will most likely be necessary 
to address the following issues: 
 
Intermittency causing output variability 
The output variability can be categorized as a) short-duration or b) long-duration. Short 
duration variability – lasting a few seconds to many minutes – is caused by wind speed 
variability, sometimes involving significant moment-to-moment variations, and rapid 
fluctuations of solar energy due to clouds, generally called ramping. Storage can be used 
to address short-duration. In this case high-power, limited-energy storage capacity is 
needed, depending on the expected amount of ramping.  
 
Time-related mismatch between generation and demand 
Storage is also well suited to address intra-day and possibly day-to-day variability. A 
significant portion of wind generation output occurs at night when demand is low. With 
storage that “off-peak” energy from wind generation can be stored and used during the day. 
With high solar penetration, peak power which otherwise would be curtailed, can be stored 
to be available to serve demand as the solar generation is falling off during late afternoon. 
Both examples prevent curtailing wind- or solar energy at high penetration levels. In these 
cases limited-power, high-energy storage capacity is needed. 
 
2.4.2 Current installed base 
 
As renewables are being implemented in the Caribbean step by step, the need for storage 
become apparent also. The U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) has setup a Global Energy 
Storage Database, which provides up-to-date information on grid-connected energy storage 
27
projects. The recorded storage facilities in the Caribbean are listed in table 2 :

There are several interesting implications of these results. These are best explained by 
discussing each scenario individually. 
 
Generator + Storage. Adding storage increases the first cost significantly (i.e. an additional 
$2 million in this example). However, it also allows for a 25% reduction in diesel use. It does 
so largely by allowing the diesel generator to operate at higher loads (and thus higher 
efficiencies) and to switch off entirely when loads are low. In this scenario, the generator 
was able to reduce its run time from 8,760 hours/year (24 hours/day, 365 days/year) to 
5,568 hours/year (an average of about 15 hours/day). Note that the levelized cost of 
electricity for this scenario is quite a bit lower than for the base case because the diesel 
savings more than outweigh the additional first cost of storage. 
 
Generator + PV. This relatively small PV system did reduce generator run time, but mostly 
during midday, when demand was high, thus aggravating the inefficient-at-part-load 
problem with diesel generators. Diesel savings were modest and levelized cost increased. 
PV as a supplement to a diesel generator without accompanying storage is unlikely to be a 
financially attractive choice although it may be worth considering as an interim step to 
become familiar with the PV technology. 
 
Generator + PV + Storage. This scenario has a very high first cost, but it cut diesel 
consumption by 50% and thus had the lowest levelized electricity cost. This is because the 
PV and the storage were able to work together such that the generator operated either at 
high output levels or shut off entirely. This is a technologically complex system, as it would 
require a sophisticated controller and software to optimize operation of the PV and storage. 
Nevertheless, as shown in Table 4, it can be cost effective from a long-term financial 
perspective. 
 
PV + Storage. This system has both the highest first cost and the highest levelized cost. 
This is because a very large PV system (7 MW) and storage system (12 MW) is required to 
ensure system reliability. This nicely points out the challenges in going to a 100% renewable 
system. One needs to oversize the system significantly or allow for the possibility of 
occasional generation shortfall. 
 
The results summarized above lead to several key findings: 
 
• Diesel generators have very low first costs but high operating costs. Although alternative 
systems using storage and/or renewables can have lower levelized costs, as discussed 
above, implementing these systems requires finding the upfront capital to cover the 
higher first costs. 
• Storage should be considered as a supplement to pure diesel systems, even without 
renewables. As discussed above, storage can allow diesel generators to operate at much 
higher efficiencies and to switch off entirely when appropriate. The diesel savings can 
more than outweigh the higher first costs of the storage. It also prepares the system for 
integrating renewables later. 
• Small amounts of renewables added to diesel-based systems are generally not a cost-
effective option. This is because some renewables, notably PV, aggravate the low-load 
inefficiency of diesel generators. 
• Combining diesel generators, renewables and storage can be the lowest cost option, 
based on levelized cost. However, such systems are complex and technologically 
sophisticated. It is suggested to add new technologies one at a time, rather than all at 
once. 
• Pure renewable systems, particularly based on PV, can be very expensive, and they will 
need to be oversized to meet electrical needs throughout the year.

Figure 1: Technical and cost data for energy storage technologies 
 
Price levels of other storage technologies have decreased (far) less as compared to 
Lithium-ion. Flow batteries are expected to show lower price levels in the near future. 
Bottom-line, price levels are volatile and need to be monitored closely, being one of the 
(key) factors when selecting a storage technology. 
 
Based upon the above and analysis of all aforementioned sources, energy storage can be 
regarded as a feasible and favorite technology for supporting renewable penetration. Price 
levels however are volatile with a downward trend and need to be monitored closely.  
 
The marketdriven position of large-scale Li-Ion batteries and its (predicted) price decreases, 
indicate a basic price level of $500/kWh with a mark-up for ancillary equipment, transport 
and implementation. 
 
 
2.5 Geothermal Energy 
 
The Lesser Antilles island arc extends 850 
km along the eastern edge of the Caribbean 
Plate. Volcanos above a subduction zone 
have largely built the islands of the arc, as 
the Atlantic Plate is being subducted under 
the Caribbean Plate.  
According to the Seismic Research Unit of 
the University of the West Indies there are 19 
potentially “active” volcanoes in the Lesser 
Antilles, six of which have erupted in the past 
400 years. Eleven volcanoes have either: 
– had severe earthquake swarms 
– had associated surface hydrothermal 
activity 
– have deposits dated within the past 10,000 
years 
– have experienced all of the above

2.5.2 St. Eustatius (Statia) 
While some heat probably remains beneath The Quill as evidenced by reported 
occurrences of thermal water in two wells drilled for drinking water, there are no known hot 
springs or paleo-thermal areas on the island (Huttrer, 1999). Geothermal development 
interest on Statia has not been evidenced in the past 5 years. 
 
According to the 2012 TNO study, the Quill shows no visible apparent fault zones like on 
Saba. It is very likely that they are covered by volcanic and marine deposits. The Quill on 
St. Eustatius is a young volcano and drilled water wells show some increased water 
temperatures towards the vent of this volcano. This suggests that infiltrated rainwater has 
been heated. As no detailed analysis of geothermal phenomena or natural seismicity data 
is available, this does not imply that there is no geothermal potential on St. Eustatius. 
Therefore, geothermal exploration is essential to further mature a business case. The most 
obvious area to explore for geothermal resources would be near the Quill. 
 
2.5.3 Economics of geothermal energy 
 
California Energy Commission (CEC) 2007 estimates place the levelized generation costs 
for a 50 MW geothermal binary plant at US$ 92 per megawatt hour and for a 50 MW dual 
flash geothermal plant at $88 per megawatt hour, which over the lifetime of the plant can 
be competitive with a variety of technologies, including natural gas.  According to the CEC 
report, natural gas costs $101 per megawatt hour for a 500 MW combined cycle power 
33
plant and $586 per megawatt hour for a 100 MW simple cycle plant .  
 
An update of the CEC prepared by KEMA estimates the investment costs for geothermal 
34
power plants at an average of US$ 4,046 (high estimate: $ 5,948, low estimate: $2,353 . 
 
On average the cost for new geothermal projects ranged from 6 to 8 cents per kilowatt-
hour according to a 2006 report. It should be noted that the cost for individual geothermal 
projects can vary significantly based upon a series of factors discussed below, and that 
costs for all power projects change over time with economic conditions. 
 
The above cost estimates relate to projects realized in the U.S. or Europe where proper 
infrastructure is in place, equipment is available together with the required experienced 
staff. 
 
The levelized generation costs for a much smaller geothermal plant of e.g. 2 MW in the 
Caribbean region, will be considerably higher.  
 
From the UK Montserrat geothermal project, we expect the investment costs to be in the 
range of US$ 8,500 per kW, which is almost double the specific investment costs for 
similar plants in the US or Europe. 
 
The levelized kWh costs are expected to be in the range of US$ 0.18 – 0.22 per kWh 
which can still be competitive with the fuel costs of diesel power plants at Caribbean 
islands including Saba. A geothermal plant will in fact replace the diesel power plants, as 
geothermal electricity is a very reliable and adjustable power source, nevertheless diesel 
generators as backup will be required during maintenance of the geothermal plants and to 
take over during accidental power interruptions. Lifetime of these diesel generators will be 
increased significantly as their operational time will be reduced substantially. A 2 MW 
power plant can produce up to 17 GWh per year.

produce electricity. Technical development is completed, the project is supported (not 
financially) by the Curaçao government. Discussions on guarantees for the supply of cooling 
38
water are ongoing. As soon as this will be resolved, the project will be realized . 
 
In view of the above cost information, we estimate the investment costs for a 10 MW OTEC 
facility at US$ 300 million, e.g. US$ 30,000 per kW, with 2.7% of investment costs for the 
yearly O&M costs. 
 
Based upon the above and all sources analyzed (see last page), OTEC technologies energy 
cannot be regarded as a feasible renewable source of energy YET for the CN islands as it 
is still in the development phase. The table below presents the estimates for OTEC capital 
costs.

This is the theoretical output in case of a constant capacity factor throughout the year. Given the demand profiles of Saba 
   
and St. Eustatius, the average capacity factor will be considerably lower.

3.1.1 General information on the electricity sector 
 
The Water- en Energiebedrijf Bonaire N.V. (hereinafter: WEB) existed already since 1978 
as a merger of the 'Overzeese Gas- en Elektriciteitsmaatschappij' (OGEM) and the Water 
Distribution Service ('Dienst Water Distributie' - DWD). 
 
In November 2007, WEB entered into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ecopower, 
which resulted in the development and realization of a new 14.5 MW power plant with wind 
42
turbines, diesel engines and storage. ContourGlobal , a global power generation company, 
owns the (renewable) power plant nowadays. 
 
Several privately owned solar installations are operational. Exact 
numbers are unclear and it is also unknown whether they are off-
grid or grid-tied as no formal registration is available. It can be 
noted that increased interest exists in installing solar installations 
for residential or commercial use, most likely due to the new 
electricity legislation at hand. An example is one of the main hotels 
in Bonaire, the Plaza Beach resort, where currently a solar 
installation of 4000 solar panels is being built.  
 
3.1.2 Electricity demand 
 
The total amount of electricity WEB sells per year is approximately 100 GWh. The average 
increase during the period 2012-2015 has been about 4% and will remain so according to 
WEB’s forecast for the next years (see next picture). 
 
 
Figure 2: Predicted, realized and forecasted energy demand Bonaire 
 
The PPA contains the exclusive right to supply electricity up to the predicted peak load and 
predicted demand. WEB forecasts growth (in excess) of predicted peak load or predicted 
demand 2 years in advance. As can be seen in previous figure, both actuals and future 
forecasts (black and blue line) show substantial and increasing excess of peak demand as 
compared to the predicted peak load (red line) according to the PPA. It is clear additional 
capacity needs to be installed to keep up to demand. 
 
The PPA includes a right of first refusal to supply this excess demand either under the 
existing PPA or amendment, based upon mutually agreed terms and conditions. This 
means ContourGlobal will have the (initial) opportunity to establish a commercial offer for 
the supply of the excess demand, which WEB needs to evaluate and discuss. The PPA

June 2016   
 
Figure 4: Electricity production system of Bonaire 
 
In the period 2011 – 2014 the share of wind power was 31 to 42%, which in fact is a bit 
lower than agreed in the PPA: 44% renewable electricity with a possible deviation of 2%. 
 
In February 2015, a 200kW pilot installation 
of 792 solar panels on the Barcadera site 
was commissioned and placed under the 
auspices of the Dutch company WEB Solar 
Power Solutions. With this installation WEB 
researches the efficiency and the impact 
solar panels on the electricity grid. The 
regular analyses of measurement provide 
WEB insights in the potential and future 
possibilities of (large-scale) energy supply 
by solar panels.  
 
As demand is growing steadily for years and production capacity was running short, WEB 
could no longer wait with taking measures. Just recently, temporary capacity was installed 
by means of containerized Aggreko diesel engines in the Hato area. These units run on 
gasoil and unfortunately do not contribute to sustainability. 
 
It was explicitly mentioned that this 
temporary solution for increased 
capacity needs has been addressed in 
collaboration with ContourGlobal, 
awaiting long-term solutions. Bonaire 
should continue its path towards 
renewable production and address the 
capacity shortage accordingly on short 
notice. 
 
 
3.1.4 Fuel costs and consumption 
 
The next table presents the estimated overall kWh-production and associated overall fuel 
consumption. No detailed information on the efficiency of the diesel is known as the diesels

• Do efficiency-driven regulations exist or are these being developed, like mandatory 
or duty-related energy labels per appliance? 
• In case air-conditioning is widely applied, are building codes available or being 
developed to reduce cooling demand? 
 
3.1.7 Renewable energy status 
 
The overall status and planned increase of renewables in Bonaire is thus as follows: 
 
 
Figure 5: Existing and planned renewable fraction Bonaire 
 
 
3.1.8 Potential scenarios for additional renewables at Bonaire 
 
There are several options for the further development of renewable electricity generation at 
Bonaire. The current PPA does not allow WEB to invest in generation capacity 
unconditionally: Contour Global has a Right of First Refusal in the PPA. 
 
There are also opportunities besides utility scale investments by WEB or Contour Global to 
further increase the share of renewable electricity generation. Additional capacity is 
necessary as the electricity demand at Bonaire is growing and there is a serious risk that 
the electricity demand cannot be guaranteed by the facilities of Contour Global. 
 
We distinguished the following opportunities for increased renewable electricity generation: 
1. Enhance decentralized solar and/or wind power with a small-scale renewable 
energy scheme, similar to the approach taken at Curaçao. Depending on how this 
scheme will be developed it may result in sufficient solar capacity being installed to 
fully cover the expected increase in electricity demand, which could result in 
renewable electricity generation shares of 50% and 60%. These scenarios will 
require additional electricity storage capacity to enable balancing of production and 
demand; 
2. Identify possible locations for utility scale solar and wind power together with energy 
storage and PMS at suitable locations at Bonaire, to be realized by CGB, WEB or 
other partners. This could increase renewable electricity generation to 60% or even 
80%. 
3. Study opportunities for OTEC to reach 100% sustainable electricity generation to be 
realized after the closure of the PPA in 2025. The development and implementation 
of innovative systems like OTEC will require quite some time as a suitable location 
should be identified, a combination with SWAC will improve the feasibility but 
requires large cooling demand close to the facility and the trajectory of the cold sea

the costs of producing and transporting electricity, the costs of electricity increased. In order 
to keep the electricity rates affordable, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) 
decided to subsidize STUCO. At the same time MEA allocated grants for investments in 
renewable energy in order to contribute to profitability without aforementioned subsidies.

Facilities (now: NuStar) is the only company with own (private) electricity production 
facilities. The STUCO and the NuStar grids are interconnected and according to STUCO, 
NuStar can be requested at all times to supply 500 kW, and excess power of another 500 
kW if available.  
 
It is known that a couple of privately owned, grid tied solar installations are operational but 
there is no formal registration.   
 
3.2.2 Electricity demand 
 
The total amount of electricity STUCO produces per year is about 14 GWh. After a long 
period of substantial growth of the total demand as of 1994 due to the start and expansion 
of NuStar, the total demand has shown a relatively flat pattern the last 3 years. 
 
 
 
Figure 6: Total yearly demand in MWh 1994-2015 St. Eustatius 
The population of St. Eustatius is, after a long period of growth, fluctuating at -3/+3% per 
year. The electricity demand is therefore expected to grow at a moderate 1% per year the 
next coming years. 
 
The demand profile on St. Eustatius shows a regular pattern for small island grids in the 
Caribbean with daily peaks at mid afternoon and early evening. In case of St. Eustatius, the 
evening peak is slightly higher than the afternoon peak due to relatively small business 
activities during the day as compared to other islands with bigger economies.

The production plant contains 9 Caterpillar diesel engines with different sizes. Engine  #7, 
#8 and #9 are the main engines with a total running capacity of 3,3 MW in total. The key 
data of these three engines are listed in the next table.

The other diesel generators (#1-6) are older and smaller. They are still available out of 
contingency point of view. Their total running capacity is in total approximately 2.4 MW. 
 
3.2.4 Fuel costs and consumption 
 
The next table presents the estimated overall kWh-production and associated overall fuel 
consumption.  
 
Fuel and kWh-production: Year 2015 
Total net production in MWh 14,000 
Total fuel consumption in liters 3,725,000 
Fuel consumption in liter per kWh 0.27 
Table 13: KWh production and fuel consumption St. Eustatius 
It must be said that these figures are based upon operations with diesel generators only. 
The recent commissioning of the solar park changed the dispatch scheme and the average 
load of the various diesel generators thus affecting the fuel efficiency. 
 
3.2.5 Efficiency of electricity distribution 
 
The efficiency of electricity distribution is commonly measured in terms of Non Revenue 
Electricity (NRE), which is the difference between the electricity sold to customers and the 
electricity fed into the network. It comprises of both technical losses, for instance due to

3.2.7 Renewable energy 
 
th
On March 24 , St. Eustatius power company STUCO celebrated the commissioning of its 
solar park that will provide over 20 percent of the island power needs.  At times St. Eustatius 
will have more than 100 percent renewable energy penetration on the grid.  
 
STUCO has initiated the second phase as of April 2016. This second phase should double 
the amount of solar production and will be commissioned in 2017. No plans are made yet 
for renewable expansion after phase 2. 
 
The overall status and planned increase of renewables in St. Eustatius is thus as follows: 
 
 
Figure 9: Existing and planned renewable fraction St. Eustatius 
 
3.2.8 Potential scenarios for additional renewables at St. Eustatius 
 
There are several options for the further development of renewable electricity generation at 
St. Eustatius. The development of the two solar parks will already realize an important 
increase of renewable electricity generation up to 40-45% of electricity demand. 
 
We distinguished the following opportunities for increased renewable electricity generation, 
as requested in the assignment: 
1. Increase of solar and wind power capacities to reach 60% of renewable electricity. 
This implies doubling of the renewable energy share in power generation. 
2. Further increase of solar and wind power, combined with adequate energy storage 
capacity, to reach 80% of renewable generation capacity; 
3. Study opportunities for OTEC to reach 100% sustainable electricity generation. The 
development and implementation of innovative systems like OTEC will require quite 
some time as a suitable location should be identified, and the trajectory of the cold 
sea water pipe will be complicated and time consuming, also in view of 
environmental studies and licensing procedures. 
 
In Chapter 4, we have analyzed these scenarios and assessed costs and benefits of 
different combinations of solar and wind power combined with energy storage.

As a consequence of the new status, Saba took over the assets of GEBE N.V. and 
established its own electricity company: Saba Electric Company N.V. (SEC), which formally 
st
started on Jan 1 2014. Due to loss of economies of scale in purchasing fuel and the costs 
of producing and transporting electricity, the costs of electricity increased. In order to keep 
the electricity rates affordable, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (MEA) decided to 
subsidize SEC. At the same time MEA allocated grants for investments in renewable energy 
in order to contribute to profitability without aforementioned subsidies.  
 
SEC is the sole electricity company in Saba, responsible for production, distribution and 
supply of electricity to end-users.  
 
As far as known, only one small, privately owned, grid tied solar installation is operational. 
An important factor is the typical red-shingled roofs that Saba houses share, giving the 
island a unique uniform cottage style. There is a strong feeling amongst inhabitants to 
preserve this style as much as possible. 
 
3.3.2 Electricity demand 
 
The total amount of electricity SEC sells per year is 8.5-9.0 GWh. The average increase 
during the period 2011-2015 has been 2%, mainly due to increased usage of air-
conditioning.  
 
 
Figure 10: Total yearly demand in MWh 2011-2015 Saba 
 
The population of Saba varies through the years. After a period of increase since the new 
status of special municipality in 2010, the last two years a decrease in population occurred, 
leaving Saba with a very small net population growth of nearly 2% since 2010. The electricity 
demand is therefore expected to grow with 1-2% per year. 
 
The demand profile on SABA shows a regular pattern for small island grids in the Caribbean 
with daily peaks at mid afternoon and early evening. In case of SABA, the evening peak is 
lower than the afternoon peak due to decreasing temperatures in the evening given the 
microclimate.

The two new ABC diesels have enough capacity to meet demand at all times, with enough 
spare capacity for growth. In case of (un-) planned maintenance of one of these new diesels, 
one or more of the older three CAT diesels can assist in production capacity needed, 
increasing the reliability of the total production site. 
 
3.3.4 Fossil fuel consumption and costs 
 
The next table presents the overall kWh-production and consumption for 2015. As the new 
power plant with ABC diesels is operational since the beginning of 2016, the fuel efficiency 
will increase substantially. Initial analysis of SEC indicates an improvement of about 15% 
down to approximately 0,25 liter per kWh. 
 
Fuel and kWh-production: Year 2015 
Total net production in kWh 9,376,000 
Total fuel consumption in liters 2,695,000 
Fuel consumption in liter per kWh 0.287

The solar park is expected to be constructed end of 2016, beginning of 2017 . This will 
influence the dispatch and the average load of diesel generators thus affecting the fuel 
efficiency.

3.3.7 Renewable energy status 
 
SEC has planned for an initial 1MW solar park in agreement with and to be financially 
supported by MEA as a first step towards an intended 2MW solar capacity. During 2014 
and 2015, initial project activities have been executed amongst which a grid stability study, 
location and soil analysis and more. It is expected that the ground breaking of the initial will 
take place in 2016. The 1 MW solar plant would reduce the fuel demand with 16%calculated 
with reference to the new diesel power plant. The intended 2MW would then add up to 32%, 
potentially supported by energy storage. 
 
The overall status and planned increase of renewables in Saba is thus as follows: 
 
Figure 13: Existing and planned renewable fraction Saba 
 
3.3.8 Potential scenarios for additional renewables at Saba 
 
There are several options for the further development of renewable electricity generation at 
Saba. The development of the solar park will already realize an important increase of 
renewable electricity generation up to approx. 16% of electricity demand. 
 
We distinguished the following opportunities for increased renewable electricity generation, 
as requested in the assignment: 
1. Increase of solar and wind power capacities to reach 60% of renewable electricity. 
This implies doubling of the renewable energy share in power generation. 
2. Further increase of solar and wind power, combined with adequate energy storage 
capacity, to reach 80% of renewable generation capacity; 
3. Study opportunities for geothermal energy to reach 100% sustainable electricity 
generation. 
 
In Chapter 4, we have analyzed these scenarios and assessed costs and benefits of 
different combinations of solar and wind power combined with energy storage.

harvest. Storage for ramp rate control has only been addressed via investment markups, 
as these need to be assessed in more detail from a financial and technical standpoint. 
 
When comparing different renewable scenarios with conventional electricity production by 
means of conventional fuel-based diesel generators, one should consider multiple fuel price 
scenarios. Fuel prices are time-related to the crude oil prices which for the Caribbean are 
56
set by the U.S. WTI crude oil index . The prices for the different fuels, HFO for Bonaire and 
LFO for St. Eustatius and Saba, were estimated based upon information provided and 
gathered, for three different crude oil price levels, US$ 50, US$90 and US$ 130. The applied 
price levels are shown in the following table: 
 
WTI crude oil price 
US$ 50 US$ 90 US$ 130 
 (per bbl) 
HFO US$ 0.51 US$ 0.91 US$ 1.32 
LFO US$ 0.73 US$ 1.32 US& 1.90 
Table 17: Fuel price levels at three crude oil scenarios 
 
4.2 Bonaire 
 
Based on the above-mentioned scenarios for fuel price developments and technical and 
economic data on solar and wind power and energy storage, an analysis is made for 
Bonaire.  
 
The first analysis was done with HOMER to determine the technically feasible solutions and 
its characteristics in terms of renewable production. This was done for each combination of 
different solar capacities (0-10MW in steps of 2MW) and different wind capacities (0-12.8 
MW in steps of 3x0.9MW wind turbines = 2.7MW). These capacities are ADDITIONAL to 
the existing wind capacities of 11.1MW. The existing situation is referred to as “as is” with 
38% renewable fraction based on 11.1MW wind and 0.25MW solar. 
 
Each of the combinations were examined with storage capacities ranging from 0-10MWh, 
potentially needed to decrease the amount of curtailment by charging batteries in case of 
overproduction and discharging later during the day when renewable production allows. 
Adding storage might increase the renewable fraction but also induces higher cost levels 
thus investments. 
 
For Bonaire two different approaches have been used to increase renewable electricity 
generation: 
 
1. Utility scale development of renewable energy, focusing on solar and wind power 
with storage. As CGB has a right of first refusal, utility scale projects have to be 
realized in close cooperation with or agreed by CGB; 
2. Decentralized implementation of primarily solar energy for which a scheme will be 
developed to stimulate households and companies to invest in their own renewable 
electricity generation. 
 
 
Bonaire utility scale scenarios 
 
The results for Bonaire are shown in the next figure. It shows per scenario (combination of 
solar and wind power) the estimated investment levels as well as the new renewable 
fraction, for increasing storage capacity.

Table 18: 60% and 80% renewable option for Bonaire 
60% renewable electricity can be reached by adding 8.1 MW of wind power (9 wind turbines 
of 0,9MW each) to the current power station which has 11.1 MW of wind already. No solar 
57
or additional storage for energy shifting is required . Due to the variability of wind power 
and having regular over-production of wind electricity (more wind electricity generation than 
demand), not all wind power can be absorbed in the grid, resulting in a rather high level of 
excess kWh of approx. 12% of wind electricity produced. 
 
80% of renewable electricity generation can be reached by adding 10.8 MW of wind power 
(12 wind turbines of 0,9MW each) and 10 MW of solar power.  This situation also results in 
significant excess kWh, approx. 20% of renewable electricity generation. 
 
For these three scenarios costs and CO2 emission reductions have been calculated. It must 
be said that many other combinations of solar and wind capacities can be examined, the 
scenarios give a firm indication but integral feasibility studies need to be executed to 
substantiate the financial investments. 
 
Affordability and sustainability: 
 
Based on the above data on investments, renewable kWh production and resulting fuel 
savings, we have assessed the kWh-costs for these scenarios, together with a 100% 
renewable electricity generation scenario based on OTEC. When the calculated kWh costs 
are lower than the fuel costs for conventional power generation, these investments will 
result in reduced cost levels for the overall production of electricity. 
 
The next tables show the yearly fuel amount savings and the fuel cost savings for the 
preferred renewable scenarios for all three oil price scenarios low, medium and high.

The fuel cost savings for scenario 3 gives the conventional fuel consumption without any 
renewables, e.g. without any wind power as an OTEC will replace all other electricity 
generation capacity and will be realized at the long run, when installed solar and wind power 
will have reached its technical and economic lifetime. Therefore the fuel savings in scenario 
3 are higher than the fuel consumption in the “as is” situation.

 The storage capacity relates to storage for energy shifting, reducing the amount of curtailment and thus increasing the 
renewable harvest. Storage for ramp rate control has only been addressed via investment mark-ups, as these need to be 
assessed in more detail from a financial and technical standpoint.

not (yet) economically attractive. The combination of cooling, using cold seawater, and fresh 
water production will improve its feasibility. Further research and specific location studies 
will be necessary, especially as deep seawater is abundant in the CN-islands. 
 
At an oil price level of US$ 90 (medium) almost all scenarios will clearly contribute to reduce 
costs of power generation. This is primarily caused by the relatively high share of wind 
power in these scenario. Wind power has by far the lowest kWh production costs due to the 
very attractive capacity factor of wind at Bonaire in combination with the investment level. 
 
The fuel savings directly result in reducing CO2 emissions. The expected CO2 emission 
reduction is presented in Table 22. The costs of CO2 emission reduction are considerably 
higher than in the Netherlands for similar investments

Bonaire decentral scenario: 
 
A second scenario to increase the renewable fraction rapidly is to stimulate households and 
companies to invest in their own decentralized renewable electricity generation. This could 
potentially compensate the increase in demand, saving WEB additional investments and 
prolonged discussions with ContourGlobal on a structured approach on generation 
extensions.

Scenario 2 8 +2.7 0 +5 60% 11,019  5,698 
Table 23: Bonaire decentral scenarios 
 
Small-scale, decentralized investments in renewable energy systems can be stimulated 
through a regulation together with a financial scheme setting a sufficiently attractive feed-
in tariff for the electricity generated. Households and companies can thus invest in small 
solar PV systems or wind turbines, depending on availability of suitable sites, especially 
for wind turbines. The scheme will have to provide sufficient certainty for the investors, 
also on the long term. It will also have to take volatility in fuel prices into account. 
 
Such a scheme will result in investments by other parties on the islands, probably 
especially on Bonaire, and thus reduce investments required by WEB or CGB. Depending 
on the success of such a scheme, additional storage capacity will be required to ensure 
balancing electricity generation and demand. The scheme will thus have to be setup in 
such a way that funds are created to add this storage when solar PV is increasing. 
 
Most of the investments and costs will be carried by a large number of households and 
companies. Therefore it is not possible to analyze the annual costs and the kWh-costs in 
 Renewable Energy Future for the Dutch Caribbean Islands Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba, June 2016 65

The results for St. Eustatius are shown in the next figure. It shows per scenario (combination 
of solar and wind power) the investment level as well as the (new) renewable fraction, for 
increasing storage capacity.  
 
 
 
Figure 17: Investment levels for renewable options at St. Eustatius 
The baselines represent the total avoided fuel expenses for a period of 10 years at a fuel 
price level associated with a WTI crude oil price of $50, $90 and $130. The $50 scenario is 
regarded “low”, the $90 scenario is regarded “medium”, and the $130 scenario is regarded 
“high”. 
 
If a scenario is left of a certain baseline, the investments will be higher than the 
(undiscounted) avoided costs of fuel for a period of 10 year given a stable either $50, $90 
or $130 oil price. 
 
The key conclusions that can be drawn from the figure are the following: 
 
• High levels of more than 90% renewable fractions can be reached by a combination 
of solar, wind and storage but investment levels increase substantially; 
 
• Investment levels are mostly between the $50/bbl and $90/bbl oil price scenarios, 
some of them stay below the low oil price scenario; 
 
• Wind contributes better than solar to the existing production mix (“as is”) in terms of 
lower total investment costs, mainly due to a higher capacity factor based on 
assumed wind speeds and related avoided additional storage costs. 
 
 
The next table shows the combinations of solar and wind power and storage that reach 60% 
of net renewable electricity production. The economical best option seems to be the 
combination of 1.89 MW solar with 2,4 MW wind and 1 MWh storage capacity. Investments

water production will improve its feasibility. Further research and specific location studies 
will be necessary, especially as deep seawater is abundant in the CN-islands. 
 
 
Affordability and sustainability 
 
Based on the above data on investments, renewable kWh production and resulting fuel 
savings, we have assessed the kWh-costs for the different scenarios with reference to the 
as-is situation. When these kWh costs are lower than the fuel costs for conventional power 
generation, these investments will result in reduced cost levels for the overall production of 
electricity. 
 
The next tables show for the preferred renewable scenarios the fuel savings and the fuel 
cost savings, for all three oil price scenarios low, medium and high. The preferred 60% and 
80% scenarios have been adjusted for the “as is” scenario which will include an estimated 
4,6MWh of storage after establishing the current expansion under implementation. Also only 
the ADDITIONAL investments on top of the “as is” 3.89MW solar /4.6MWh storage 
installation is taken into account. The investment costs shown in Table 28 are therefore 
lower than those indicated in Tables 25 and 26.

Again, as for Bonaire, the fuel savings in scenario 3 are higher than the fuel usage in the 
“as is” situation, as the OTEC will replace all other renewable electricity generation options, 
also the already installed/planned 3.89 MW. OTEC is expected to become available after 
the lifetime of this solar power capacity has expired.

Figure 19: Investment levels for renewable options at Saba 
 
The key conclusions that can be drawn from the figure are the following: 
 
• High levels of more than 90% renewable fractions can be reached by a combination 
of solar, wind and storage but investment levels increase substantially; 
• Investment levels are above the oil price level of $50/bbl (low), some of them also 
above the $90/bbl (medium); 
• Adding wind to the planned solar capacity contributes better than increasing solar 
capacity further in terms of lower total investment costs, mainly due to a higher 
capacity factor based on assumed wind speeds and related avoided additional 
storage costs. 
 
Table 29 shows the combinations of solar and wind power and storage that reach 60% of 
renewable electricity in the grid. The economical best option is the combination of 2 MW 
solar with 2 MW wind and 1 MWh storage capacity. Investments for this combination are 
US$ 13.6 million. This combination has the least excess kWh-production although still more 
than 17% of the additional renewable electricity cannot be absorbed.

and needs proper attention.

8. OTEC is a potential renewable energy source in the future, abundantly available at 
the islands, as it needs deep waters with high surface temperatures. Investment 
costs however, are still very high, although interesting projects are being developed 
in the region (Martinique) and need to be followed closely. A combination of OTEC 
with SWAC and fresh water production will improve its economic feasibility; 
9. There are no other renewable energy options available at the islands: 
a. Biomass or biofuel is simply not available, Saba and St. Eustatius do not 
have any land available, and if so, it would be used for agricultural purposes. 
For Bonaire biomass production from the sea might be a future option if it 
can be combined with durable coral reef management. Research and 
development results should be waited for.  
b. Waste: There are no significant quantities of waste available on the islands 
to allow development of a waste-to-energy facility, incineration or digestion 
of organic wastes. 
 
 
Bonaire: 
 
Bonaire’s electricity company WEB has established a PPA with ContourGlobal. 
ContourGlobal operates the power plant, including 11.1 MW of wind power, producing 
practically all electricity for Bonaire. As demand has been and will remain to be growing 
rapidly, additional production capacity, preferable renewable production capacity is needed 
 
Through the PPA ContourGlobal has a Right of First Refusal for the development of 
additional generation capacity. Although (or maybe because) the PPA can be interpreted 
multiple ways, it has slowed down execution of structural expansion and led to installing 
costly temporary containerized Aggreko diesels.  
 
Development of solar and wind power could therefore partly be realized through 
decentralized efforts: fostering households and companies to invest in their own small-scale 
solar or wind power generation. This can be stimulated through an appropriate scheme, 
setting feed-in tariffs that are sufficiently attractive for the target groups and still enabling 
WEB and/or ContourGlobal to take adequate measures for supply and demand balancing 
and management.  
 
It is expected that with an adequate incentive scheme the share of renewable electricity 
generation at Bonaire could increase to 50% and maybe even 60%. 
 
Further developments could be realized together with CGB through larger scale 
implementation of solar and wind power combined with electricity storage and PMS. This 
may result in renewable electricity generation shares up to 60% and 80%. 
 
100% renewable electricity supply can only be achieved with OTEC, the only available other 
potential renewable energy source. The variability of solar and wind power does not allow 
to make the electricity supply fully sustainable as it will need an increasing amount of 
storage with high associated costs. OTEC is abundantly available and Bonaire seems to 
have favorable circumstances for OTEC development. Current costs are extremely high but 
may decrease over time to competitive levels. 
 
St. Eustatius: 
St. Eustatius is already progressing to more renewable electricity generation in the very 
near future. A 1.89 MW solar park has just become operational and tenders have just been 
published for a second solar park with a capacity of an estimated 2MW and an estimated 
4MWh of storage, which is expected to be commissioned during the first half of 2017.  
As previously mentioned, this will bring the renewable fraction above 40%.

ANNEX 1 Factsheet Wind Energy 
 
Wind technology 
 
Wind power technologies transform the kinetic energy of the wind into useful mechanical 
power. The kinetic energy of the airflow provides the motive force that turns the wind turbine 
blades that, via a drive shaft, provide the mechanical energy to power the generator in the 
wind turbine. Wind power technologies come in a variety of sizes and styles and can 
generally be categorized by whether they are horizontal axis or vertical axis wind turbines 
(HAWT and VAWT), and by whether they are located onshore or offshore.  
 
The power output of wind turbines is determined by the capacity of the turbine (in kW or 
MW), the wind speed art the specific location and height of the turbine, and the diameter of 
the rotors. The maximum energy than can be harnessed by a wind turbine is roughly 
proportional to the swept area of the rotor. Blade design and technology developments 
are one of the keys to increasing wind turbine capacity and output. By doubling the rotor 
diameter, the swept area and therefore power output is increased by a factor of four. This 
is the reason why wind turbines become bigger and bigger as far as progressing design 
59
and materials allow (see figure 1) .  
 
 
Figure 1: Development of wind turbines 
The biggest commercially available wind turbine today is the Vestas V164 of 8MW. This 
turbine has a tower height of 140-meter, a tip height of 220 meter, and a swept area of 
2
21,000 m . 
 
Besides the swept area, the average wind speed at the specific location and height 
determines the actual output of the wind turbine. The output is proportional to the velocity 
of the wind to the third power. If wind speed doubles, the output increases eight-fold. 
Obviously, wind turbines are built at locations with high average wind speeds. 
 
The output of a wind turbine varies with the fluctuating wind speed. At very low wind speeds, 
there is insufficient torque exerted by the wind on the turbine blades to make them rotate. 
However, as the speed increases, the wind turbine will begin to rotate and generate

Wind energy worldwide 
  
Wind energy developments 
 
Wind energy is rapidly increasing worldwide. According to the recent publication of the 
60
Global Wind Energy council (GWEC) , the total installed wind energy power at the end of 
2015 is 432,419 MW, and showed a growth of 63.013 MW during 2015, which is an increase 
of approximately 17%. The next figure shows that China was the main contributor to the 
growth in 2015, expanding its overall share of installed capacity even more. 
 
 
 
Like other renewable energy technologies, wind energy is capital intensive, but has no fuel 
costs. The key parameters governing wind energy economics are the: 
 
• Investment costs (including those associated with project financing); 
• Operation and maintenance costs (fixed and variable); 
• Capacity factor (based on wind speeds and turbine availability factor); 
• Economic lifetime; and 
• Cost of capital. 
Although capital intensive, wind energy is regarded one of the most cost-effective 
renewable technologies in terms of the cost per kWh of electricity generated. 
 
 
Wind energy installation costs 
 
The installed cost of a wind energy project is dominated by the upfront capital cost for the 
wind turbines (including towers and installation). Wind turbine investment costs have been 
investigated by different organizations like IRENA, US Department of Energy (DoE) and 
ECN. The next table shows typical ranges for onshore and offshore wind farms for 
61
developed countries .

In its 2015 report for SDE+ 2016, ECN estimated the O&M costs in the Netherlands at about 
€ 0.01/kWh (or € 20 – 30/kW), which is very much in line with the US cost estimates.  
 
Other fixed costs for insurance, land, taxes, grid connection, road maintenance etc. are 
estimated by ECN at € 12,4/kW/year. In view of the above, we have estimated the O&M 
costs for wind turbines on the CN islands at US$ 54 for Bonaire and US$ 81 for Saba and 
St. Eustatius. These figures include the costs for inspection and cleaning (required under 
these islands conditions) and 1% insurance for Saba and St. Eustatius. 
 
 
Wind energy kWh prices 
 
For wind power, the LCOE costs per kWh represents the sum of all costs of a fully 
operational wind power system over the lifetime of the project with financial flows discounted 
to a common year. The principal components of the economics of wind power systems 
include capital costs, operation and maintenance costs and the expected annual energy 
production. 
 
The LCOE of onshore wind has fallen strongly since the first commercial wind farms were 
developed. In the United States, the cost of electricity generated from wind fell from about 
$ 0.30/kWh in 1984 to a low of around $ 0.055/kWh in 2005. A similar trend occurred in 
Europe, where the LCOE of wind declined by 40% between 1987 and 2006 for wind farms 
on good coastal sites. There has been a steady decline in the price demanded in the wind 
auctions since 2009. The 2009 auction saw prices of between $ 0.09 and $ 0.10/kWh, but 
by 2011 the price range was between $ 0.065 and US 0.070/kWh.  
 
IRENA indicates kWh-costs for onshore wind power projects to be $ 0.06 to $ 0.11/kWh. 
However, the exact value depends on project specifics (e.g. the wind turbines’ capacity 
factor) and different sources often use different boundaries (i.e. some studies include tax 
incentives, others don’t).  
 
ECN has calculated the overall electricity costs for onshore wind energy in the Netherlands 
to be in the range of € 0.07 – 0.093/kW, depending on the wind regime. The lowest costs 
obviously for the best wind regime.

The 2015 ECN report on wind assessment from a technology point of view, showed average 
wind speeds at 60m heights of 6.2 m/s for Saba and 7.0 m/s for St. Eustatius. They are 
based on recent 20 months wind speeds measurements and resulted in the selection of 
69
class III wind turbines for both islands, suitable for these wind speeds. As a reference, the 
existing wind turbines on Bonaire are class IA compliant, thus suitable for (very) high wind 
speeds.  
 
However, due to potential hurricane exposure, measures should be taken to mitigate the 
associated risks. This can be done by an additional insurance policy, which leads to 
increased costs of about 1% of the investment per year. It is very likely insurance companies 
70
will require class II wind turbines to mitigate their risk, maybe even class I to mitigate their 
risk.  
 
ECN calculated the energy yield for several types of (class II and III) wind turbines based 
upon the limited measurements of actual wind speeds and directions. The outcome showed 
a maximum capacity factor of 35% (rounded) for St. Eustatius and 27% (rounded) for Saba. 
These values are used in this study for further analysis. It must be said that the report 
calculated an uncertainty of 14.7% and 12.7% for Saba and St. Eustatius respectively, 
mainly due to uncorrelated long-term wind speed data. 
 
Shirley & Kammen estimate the fixed maintenance costs at $ 36/kW/year based upon the 
new Aruba wind park. It is considerably higher than the fixed O&M costs in the U.S. but in 
the same range as for Europe. For all three islands a 50% add-on is applied due to small-
scale cost increases. For Saba and Statia an additional 1% of the investment costs will be 
added caused by hurricane insurance policies. 
 
71
Mazars conducted an in depth investigation into the investment costs for the Bonaire 
power generation facility of ContourGlobal (Ecopower at time of commissioning). This 
research provided a detailed overview of all direct and indirect investment costs. The costs 
related to the wind park are shown below. 
 
Ecopower windpark investment: Costs: 
11 windturbines (900 kW) including PMS US$ 18,720,000 
1 Sorobon wind turbine (existing) US$ 1,078,000 
Cable laying and civil works US$ 2,034,000 
Cabling windpark US$ 596,000 
Site investigation and excavation works US$ 452,000 
Testing and commissioning US$ 149,000 
Other civil works and construction US$ 400,000 
Financing costs (50%) US$ 2,320,000 
Development and project management (50% US$ 1,370,000 
Insurance, due diligence a/o (50%) US$ 900,000 
Total investment costs: US$ 28,019,000 
Capacity: 11,1 MW 
Investment costs per kW installed: US$ 2,524 
Table 3: Costs for the Bonaire wind park 
Part of the civil and construction works can most probably be attributed to the conventional 
power plant at this location. The above costs comply well with the Kammen estimates. 
No data for variable O&M costs were given but we estimate those at approximately double 
of these costs in the US as well.

Wind energy integration in (small) electricity grids 
 
Wind power fluctuates over time, mainly under the influence of meteorological fluctuations. 
For large individual wind turbines, the variation in the power output on seconds scale is very 
small, due to the averaging of the wind field across the rotor and the filtering effect of the 
73
turbine inertia . In case of a wind farm, consisting of multiple wind turbines, the variation in 
the aggregated power output is small for time-scales of even tens of seconds, due to the 
averaging of the output of individual turbines across the wind farm. The variations within an 
hour are much more significant and need to be taken into account.  
 
Regular spinning reserves of the operational diesel generators can address these (minutes 
to hours) fluctuations of wind power. For the CN-islands however, smaller wind turbines (< 
1MW) will be applicable. Unfortunately, for these kinds of turbines no data on power 
fluctuations on a second or minute scale is available. Although short-term wind output 
variations seem to be limited to minutes instead of seconds as well, this needs to be 
investigated for the individual islands, locations and wind turbines at hand. 
 
Bottom-line, wind energy is intermittent energy. Due to the variability of wind energy, backup 
power must be available at all time to ensure balancing of electricity production with 
consumption. Back-up power should be provided two different purposes.  
 
The first purpose is to provide energy when wind energy is not available during period of 
less wind or even no wind at all. As no wind periods do occur, the back up should be capable 
of providing full wind power for a certain period of time.  
 
The second purpose is to provide power in case of wind ramping due to short-term wind 
effects. As said, for the applicable wind turbines, the time scale of the fluctuations in output 
needs to be confirmed. 
 
Backup energy and power can be provided through diesel generators with sufficient 
flexibility or energy storage devices (batteries; small hydro pumping). 
 
Additionally, a power management system (PMS) is needed to control the total electrical 
system. The PMS is basically a control system with software, real-time connected to all 
mayor components like the diesel generators, the wind turbines, and storage devices. It 
continuously balances the demand and the supply of electricity by sending commands to 
all connected units based upon many variables. A proper functioning communication 
system is key. 
When increasing the penetration of wind and/or solar capacity, at a certain point the power 
output will exceed the demand during the day. This will open the way to shut down the 
diesel generators completely in order to harvest as much wind power as possible with 
minimum storage capacity required. As the diesel generators supply the frequency (control) 
of the network, this needs to be taken over. One of the main options being developed by 
74
the marketplace is the so-called grid-forming inverters (GFI) , which will take over the 
frequency control function. However, these electronic devices lack inertia and additional 
grid stability measures need to be taken to guarantee a stable frequency and voltage. 
 
All aforementioned measures (storage, power management, GFI’s, grid stability 
measures,...) induce additional costs and need to be included in the business case.

ANNEX 2: Factsheet Solar Energy 
The Technology 
 
The sun delivers its energy to us in two main forms: heat and light. Therefore there are two main 
types of solar power systems, namely, Solar Thermal systems that trap heat to warm up water, 
76
and solar PV systems that convert 
sunlight directly into electricity as shown in 
the picture. 
 
In case of solar thermal systems a fluid is 
circulated through the solar heat collectors 
to capture the heat and deliver it to a water 
storage tank. When users need hot 
water, the solar-heated water in the 
storage tank pre-feeds the primary water-
heating system.  
Such a system can be installed to provide 
cooling too. In this case the solar heat 
collection system transmits the energy to a 
refrigeration device which cools the air, providing air-conditioning. It is far less efficient to run an 
airconditioning system on solar PV systems. 
 
In case of PV systems, the solar cells on a solar panel are exposed to sunlight resulting in the 
generation of direct current (“DC”) electricity due to the charaterictics of the semiconducting 
materials, such as silicon. An inverter then converts the DC into alternating current (“AC”) 
electricity, so that it can feed into one of the building’s AC distribution boards. In case of large 
utility scale installations, large inverters feed the electricity directly into the grid. 
 
The output of any solar energy system obviously depends on the amount of solar energy, also 
called solar irradiance, which in case of PV, is commonly expressed in kWh/m2 per day. Solar 
panels are rated accordingly, typically 250-300W so the rating represents the maximum output 
per day under standard conditions. Specific software using solar data and solar diagrams help 
determining the expected average output with optimum installation variables like orientation and 
tilt for the location at hand. 
 
Solar energy is intermittent energy as it depends on the amount of sunlight, which varies in time.  
Besides the seasonal change in sunrise and sunset, clouding substantially influences solar 
energy. The electricity output of PV systems can change substantially in seconds as the 
photovoltaic effect reacts instantaneously to changes in solar irradiation. High penetration of PV 
systems thus burdens the stability of any electricity grid and requires sufficient fast balancing 
power.  
 
In case of many distributed PV systems the variations of total solar output power due to clouding 
effects, averages out, decreasing the total need for stabilizing balancing power. However, 
                                                                 
76
 PV stands for PhotoVoltaics: converting solar energy into direct current electricity using semiconducting material that exhibits the 
photovoltaic effect.

Solar energy worldwide 
 
Solar technology has been globally commercialized for many years with costs reduced to a 
competitive level and technical support readily available everywhere. Especially PV is regarded 
as a key component to the energy mix of the future as it is a mature technology with decreasing 
cost levels, lifetime of 25-50 years with a low level of maintenance. It can be integrated with other 
technologies relatively easily to become part of a hybrid system. 
 
77
According to the latest report of the International Energy Agency (IEA) renewables are expected 
to be the largest source of net additions to power capacity over the medium term. China, India 
and Brazil and other developing countries account for two-thirds of the renewable expansion over 
the medium term. Solar PV is the second-largest source of new capacity (after on-shore wind) 
with a third of this deployment. 
 
As the U.S. and Europe have been leading the way with regards to renewables and because they 
are important economic partners of the Caribbean region, their respective developments of solar 
energy is briefly touched in the next paragraphs. 
 
 
United States 
 
2015 was a momentous 
year for solar power in the 
United States. Solar PV 
deployments reached an 
all-time high of 7,260 MW, 
up 16% over 2014 and 8.5 
times the amount installed 
five years earlier, 
according to the latest 
report of the Solar Energies 
Industries Association 
78
SEIA . 
It is forecasted that 16 GW 
of new PV installations will 
come on-line in 2016, up 
120% over 2015. Utility PV 
is expected to drive the 
majority of demand, 
accounting for nearly three-
fourths of new installations.  
 
To a large extent, the steady increase of solar power is driven by a 30 percent federal tax credit 
79
for solar systems on residential and commercial properties . This tax credit, recently extended 
to the end of 2016, is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the income taxes that a person or company 
would otherwise pay the federal government, based on the amount of investment in solar 
property. Various additional state incentives exist and may be applicable too.

GW. Solar shares are high as compared worldwide, on average 4% of electricity consumption; in 
the most mature markets, Germany, Greece and Italy, around 8%. 
 
PV in Europe shows a relatively highly distributed pattern due to feed-in tariff incentives in many 
countries. Feed-in tariffs have been steadily lowered in many European countries the last couple 
of years. Currently, a transition takes place from incentive based growth to new market-based 
81
frameworks. As a result, distributed PV is evolving slowly in the direction of self-consumption , 
creating maximum return on investments.  
 
However, this drives the question of grid financing and incomes at the retail level, which is vital in 
several countries. For example, Spain implemented a kind of “solar tax” that is almost prohibitive 
for any investments in self-consumption, while countries such as Belgium are going to oblige PV 
end-users to contribute to grid costs for their self-consumed electricity, even from existing 
systems. 
 
The installation costs differ per country due to different markets, price regimes, and incentives. 
82
Based upon a recent Fraunhofer/ISE report , the hardware costs for rooftop systems up to 
100kW in Germany, one of the leading solar countries in Europa, have been stabilized at €1.3 /W 
in 2015. The total installation costs is estimated between €1.8-2.2 /W in most countries in 
83
Europe , far less than the installation costs in the U.S. due to substantially less administrative 
red tape. 
 
O&M costs are very limited in the US and Europe. IRENA estimates these costs at US$ 6,5 per 
kW. However, under circumstances at the CN islands, more regular inspection and cleaning will 
be required due to high moisture levels and salt in the air. We therefore estimate the O&M costs 
for solar PV at the CN islands at US$ 15 /kW. This should be further increased with 1% insurance 
costs for Saba and Statia due to possible hurricanes. For Saba and Statia overall O&M is thus 
estimated at US$ 34 /kW. 
 
                                                                 
81
   The self-consumption of solar energy refers to the proportion of energy, which is used directly in the building where a PV system 
is located (Ref.5)

Therefore the scheme was modified in 2014, making it less attractive with now payback times of 
around 8 years.

Aruba’s electricity distribution company N.V. Elmar allows end-users to connect solar 
installations with limited capacity. A grid usage fee per installed kW applies as well as feed-in 
tariffs for excess energy. The number of installations is not known. Aruba’s electricity production 
90
company WebAruba operates a 3.5MW solar power plant at the airport and has recently issued 
an initiative to implement an additional 5MW ground-mounted solar power plant and roof-top 
installations on schools and public building of 2.5MW in total. 
 
St. Maarten lags behind with solar energy as no legal, technical and/or financial regulation is in 
place. It is known however that at least several tens of solar installations have been built and 
connected to the grid.  
 
The CN-islands have embraced solar energy just recently, each at their own pace. Statia utility 
company STUCO is leading the way and just commissioned a 1.89MW solar power plant in 
combination with storage and a power management system. Saba is executing a plan to 
commission a 1MW solar plant and Bonaire has installed a 250kW solar system to gain 
experience and determine potential next steps. 
 
91
With regards to solar heating and solar cooling, the results so far are disappointing . Solar Water 
Heater installations are steadily increasing in the Caribbean, for warm water provisioning for 
homes and hotels. Barbados is the leading example with over 50,000 solar water heaters installed 
and can be regarded as a mature market. Other investigated islands show either potential growth 
or emerging characteristics. The main barriers are lack of incentive programs and regulations like 
product certifications and installer certifications. 
 
Solar cooling is just beginning to be recognized with regards to its potential value as cooling 
demand just perfectly matches the PV supply curve. No reliable and useful data is available at 
this point in time.

Solar energy integration in (small) electricity grids 
 
The output from solar panels obviously depends on the amount of sunlight, called sun irradiance. 
It shows a regular pattern with increasing output at sunrise, maximum output at solar noon and 
decreasing output at sunset.  
 
However, the output will change suddenly due to clouds. Fast fluctuations in output disrupt the 
second-to-second balance between total electric supply and demand. Due to this variability of 
solar energy, backup power must be available at all time to ensure balancing of electricity 
production with consumption.  
 
Back-up power should be provided for two different purposes. The first purpose is to provide 
energy when solar energy is not available, either during the night and early morning/afternoon, or 
during days with heavy clouding with reduced solar output.  
 
The second purpose is to provide power in case of solar ramping due to short-term clouding 
effects. Short-term solar output variations occur on seconds scale due to the non-existence of 
any inertia. 
  
Another way of addressing the effect of 
variability of solar power is to spread the 
capacity over multiple locations. A lot of 
93
research has been done by Hoff & Perez , 
showing that the relative output variability 
decreases as the number of PV systems 
increases. It eventually reaches the point 
where output variability is negligible relative 
to the total fleet capacity. The figure gives 
an impression what can happen with the 
output variability when spreading the solar 
capacity over 20 locations as compared to 
one single location. The latter shows far less variability, which results in a more predictable output. 
As cloud transit speeds influence the results, the effect of multiple locations will differ per case. 
Bottom-line, a distributed solar model is to be preferred in all cases. 
 
In any case, either with one location or multiple locations, a certain amount of variability will remain 
and back-up power is needed. Backup energy and power can be provided through: 
• Diesel generators, with sufficient flexibility; 
• Energy storage (batteries; small hydro pumping). 
Additionally, a power management system (PMS) is needed to control the total electrical system. 
The PMS is basically a control system with software, real-time connected to all mayor components 
like the diesel generators, the solar system, and storage devices. It continuously balances the 
demand and the supply of electricity by sending commands to all connected units based upon 
many variables. A proper functioning communication system is key.

ANNEX 3: Factsheet Energy storage 
 
General information 
 
Electricity systems in remote areas and on islands can use energy storage to integrate renewable 
generation and help meet continually varying electricity production by renewable sources like 
solar power and wind power. Energy storage technologies vary widely in design, technological 
maturity and cost. There is no single best storage technology, and storage is not necessarily 
appropriate for all island electricity systems. 
 
In addition to helping integrate renewables, storage can also contribute significant value by 
increasing the operating efficiency of diesel generators. These generators are much more efficient 
when operated at high load factors, and the addition of storage can significantly reduce the 
number of hours they operate at low or minimum load factors. 
 
Case studies of storage applications for island and remote locations point to several lessons 
99
learned from project experiences elsewhere, including : 
 
• Pay close attention to system design, particularly ensuring that all system components are 
sized correctly and can work together. 
• The more system components, the greater the complexity and challenge of system 
integration. 
• Do not expect new technologies/pilots to be financially viable. 
• Do not underestimate the transport costs, complexity and time requirements associated 
with getting equipment and expertise to rural/isolated locations. 
• System monitoring and operation and maintenance (O&M) are critical to ensure system 
reliability/longevity. 
• Test and debug system components before sending them out to rural/isolated locations. 
• Diesel generator oversizing is rampant and contributes to high diesel consumption. 
• It is critical to make systems financially sustainable. Even if subsidies cover first costs, 
operating costs (including battery replacement and O&M) will need to be covered by 
electricity sales/revenues or continuing subsidies. 
• End-user buy-in (financially and politically) is critical 
 
The first step when considering storage is to conduct careful analyses of the costs and benefits 
of storage. Storage can help integrate renewables and reduce diesel use; however it comes at a 
cost that must be considered. If storage is desirable, further system design analysis is needed to 
determine the optimal type of storage. This can be done with free or low-cost system design and 
analysis tools, such as the HOMER modeling system (see further).

Lifetime 
A second element to look at is 
the lifetime. Some 
technologies measure lifetime 
according to how much they 
are charged and discharged 
[cycles], while other 
technologies will lose 
functionality due to time 
passing [years] and yet others 
have lifetimes limited by total 
energy throughput [kWhlife or 
Ahlife]. As they age, most 
storage technologies will suffer 
from degraded performance.  
For cell-based batteries, including lead-acid and lithium-ion, the expected lifetime shortens with 
deeper discharging the battery due to cell degradation. This means that these systems should be 
designed carefully as lifetime depends on the number of cycles. As the depth of discharge 
increases, the maximum number of cycles decreases. This can decrease lifetime substantially as 
can be seen in the illustrative figure. 
 
 
Efficiency 
Every storage technology will require more energy to charge than can be discharged. This loss 
of energy is typically expressed as a percentage known as round-trip efficiency [%], which is the 
ratio of energy discharged from storage to the energy input into storage. There will be some 
energy losses during the process of storing the energy and some energy losses when converting 
the stored energy back into electricity. These both contribute to the round-trip efficiency. Round-
trip efficiency affects the costs of storage. A less efficient storage system will require more 
electricity to store the same amount of electricity supplied than a more efficient storage system. 
For example, if it costs $0.50/kWh to generate electricity and 20% of that is lost in the storage 
system, then the effective cost per delivered kWh is $0.625/kWh – plus the cost of the storage 
system. 
 
 
Preferred technology 
Storage technologies are undergoing rapid advancement, and there is as yet no clear winning 
technology, which can be selected at all times. This is partly due to the fact that different storage 
technologies have different applications. The selection of the right type of storage technology is 
not a straightforward exercise and many factors need to be taken into account, which include 
factors other than the aforementioned main technical metrics like space limitations or performance 
101
guarantees .  
As rapid developments take place, many new technologies emerge. In Figure 2, some key 
technologies are displayed with respect to their associated initial capital investment requirements 
102
and technology risk versus their current phase of development

Costs of storage technologies 
 
 
Initial Capital Cost 
 
The capital costs provided here are estimates based on professional experience and informal 
surveys of publicly available prices. Costs for a specific system will vary across a wide range of 
factors. These factors include system size, location, local labor rates, market variability, intended 
use of the storage system, local climate, environmental considerations and transport/access 
issues.  
 
It is important to recognize that installing storage will impose additional costs, commonly called 
balance-of-system (abbreviated BoS) costs. These include safety equipment (e.g. fuses, current 
fault protection), inverters/rectifiers, system controllers, remote monitoring equipment and 
supplemental sensors. The needed equipment will vary considerably, depending on the specifics 
of the electricity system. BoS equipment can have a large impact on the total system cost, ranging 
103
anywhere from 100% to 400% more than the costs of the storage technology alone . 
 
The principal price bases for comparing technologies are the prices per amount of power that the 
storage can deliver [$/kW] and costs per amount of energy capacity [$/kWh cap].  
 
When looking at costs, it is also important to consider the expected lifetime of the technology 
because frequent replacement will increase costs of the storage system. To capture the entire 
lifetime cost, the capital cost of the battery is divided by the total expected lifetime energy 
throughput [$/kWh life]. The lifetime cost of storage provides insight into the cost of storing a kWh 
of electricity and indicates the expected additional cost for each unit of electricity stored. The costs 
do not include site-specific factors such as tariffs, taxes and shipping costs. 
 
 
Operating Costs 
 
Technologies require ongoing operation and maintenance to remain at peak performance. In 
reality, a number of factors will influence ongoing O&M costs, including how often the storage 
equipment is used, ambient temperatures, handling of the equipment, adherence to the 
recommended maintenance schedule, quality of installation, protection from overcharging, 
protection from over-discharging, the rate at which the equipment is cycled and the quality of the 
storage equipment.  
 
For simplicity, all of these factors are generally bundled in a typical annual cost based on the size 
of the equipment [$/kW x yr].  
 
 
Cost estimates

Table 1 shows cost estimates from IRENA in 2012 for most relevant storage technologies . It also 
includes some of the aforementioned key metrics as lifetime in years and amount of cycles. The 
price bandwidths are relatively high, especially for Lithium-ion batteries. It must be emphasized

Price levels of other storage technologies have decreased (far) less as compared to Lithium-ion. 
Flow batteries are expected to show lower price levels in the near future. Bottom-line, price levels 
are volatile and need to be monitored closely, being one of the (key) factors when selecting a 
storage technology.

Table 2: DoE Global Energy Storage Database Caribbean 
 
 
Table 2 shows a very limited amount of storage facilities, only 6 out of the 11 installations are 
recorded as operational. The recently installed and operational 1,400 kW Lithium-ion storage 
facility in St. Eustatius is not yet recorded in aforementioned list. 
 
This overview, although it might not fully represent the current installed storage capacity in the 
Caribbean, shows that storage is still very limited in the Caribbean and will, given the expected 
growth of renewables, be subject to increasing implementation. Tender procedures for 5MW 
storage facilities for both Guadeloupe and Martinique are already being executed. 
 
 
Model island simulation 
To illustrate the potential role and added value of storage systems in small island electricity grids, 
106
a fictional island has been modeled and analyzed by IRENA , which will be par presented in the 
following paragraphs. 
 
It must be said that this simulation and analysis are based upon assumptions, which will 
be different for the individual CN-islands today. Specifically the cost levels used do not 
reflect current pricing levels. It is therefore meant for illustrative purposes only in order to 
show the potential effects on the business case of adding solar and storage facilities to a 
fully diesel-operated production system. 
 
The HOMER modeling system, which is emerging as the international standard for modeling of 
107
smaller and distributed renewable electricity systems, is used. HOMER is an electricity system 
design tool that chooses an optimal mix of generation resources from a user-defined set of 
choices and provides as outputs capital and operating expenses. The results shown here are for 
a typical, or representative, small island electricity system. However, these results may not be 
applicable to all such systems. Costs, insolation (sunlight) levels, electricity demand, load shape 
and other variables vary across systems, and their values affect how renewables and storage 
interact and perform. 
 
For this analysis, a fictional island located was created in the Caribbean, near Puerto Rico. The 
electricity system on this island serves 1,000 households, each with an average electricity 
demand of 500 watts, totaling 500 kW residential average demand. The island also has a 
comparably sized commercial and industrial average demand of 500 kW. The load factor is 0.37, 
meaning that the total peak demand is 2.7 MW. The daily load shape follows typical working hours 
with a midday peak. For a base case, it is assumed that a single diesel generator serves the 
island, with a peak rated output of 3.5 MW.  
 
It is assumed that this diesel generator costs $250/kW. Furthermore, it is assumed that diesel fuel 
is available at a price of $1/liter. The efficiency of this diesel generator rises sharply with load, 
which is typical of diesel generators. The final critical assumption is that electricity supply always 
equals or exceeds demand.  
 
To demonstrate the potential roles of storage and renewables, the island is then modeled with 
several alternative electricity generation scenarios:

than outweigh the higher first costs of the storage. It also prepares the system for integrating 
renewables later. 
• Small amounts of renewables added to diesel-based systems are generally not a cost-effective 
option. This is because some renewables, notably PV, aggravate the low-load inefficiency of 
diesel generators. 
• Combining diesel generators, renewables and storage can be the lowest cost option, based 
on levelized cost. However, such systems are complex and technologically sophisticated. It is 
suggested to add new technologies one at a time, rather than all at once. 
• Pure renewable systems, particularly based on PV, can be very expensive, and they will need 
to be oversized to meet electrical needs throughout the year. 
 
 
Table 3: Results of adding storage to island electricity grids 
 
 
 
Summary 
 
Based upon the above and analysis of all aforementioned sources, energy storage can be 
regarded as a feasible and favorite technology for supporting renewable penetration. Price levels 
however are volatile with a downward trend and need to be monitored closely.  
 
Based on the marketdriven position of large-scale Li-Ion batteries and its (predicted) price 
decreases, a basic price level of $500/kWh can be assumed with a mark-up for ancillary 
equipment, transport and implementation.

ANNEX 4: Factsheet Geothermal Energy 
 
Geothermal energy technology 
 
Geothermal energy is a continuous source of energy, unlike the variable renewable energy 
sources of wind and solar. Since the heat is trapped inside the earth, it is not depleted. With the 
high world oil prices (until mid-2014) and the oil and gas emission concerns, geothermal energy 
is generating greater interest everywhere. Geothermal heat was recognized first by the hot 
springs ancient cultures enjoyed at various hot spots around the world. Its capability to produce 
electricity came to light almost a century ago thanks to Italian Prince Piero Ginori Conti. Since 
then, as technology and understanding increased, two specific methods of creating energy have 
enabled people to generate both heat and electricity. 
 
Geothermal heat is found at depths from 2,000 to 4,000 meters in water layers with water 
temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 degrees Celsius. This heat can be used directly when hot 
water or heating of buildings or processes is required but can also be used to generate electricity. 
Efficiency of electricity generation increases with water temperature. The technology used for 
geothermal energy is similar to oil drilling and production, combined with electricity production 
based on heat.

General cost estimates 
 
There are several phases between exploration of potential resources and construction of a power 
plant. Figure 2 shows the estimated development costs for a typical geothermal power plant. As 
shown in Figure 2, the upfront activities of Resource Identification, Resource Evaluation, and Test 
Well Drilling account for approximately 13% of the overall cost; these costs are nonetheless 
significant because they are risky activities (i.e., subject to dry holes) and, as a result, have high 
financing costs. The remainder of the capital investment (87%) comes in the later phases of 
drilling and construction. 
 
 
Figure 2: Sample costs per development stage of a geothermal plant of 50 MWe 
The project costs presented in Figure 2 are location-specific and can vary significantly from one 
site to another. Costs depend on resource temperature and pressure, reservoir depth and 
permeability, fluid chemistry, drilling market, size of development, number and type of plants (dry 
steam, flash, binary or hybrid) used, et cetera. 
The above costs are for geothermal plants in the US and Europe. The preparatory and 
development costs for similar facilities in the Caribbean will be considerably higher. The above 
cost estimates have been prepared for a 50MWe geothermal power plant. A smaller plant, less 
than 10 MWe or in the range of 1 – 2 MWe will be much more expensive. We expect investment 
costs for a 2 MWe geothermal power plant to be in the range of US$ 7,000 to 10,000 per kW, 
especially as there will only be a minor reduction in the costs of exploration and production drilling. 
The breakdown of costs among the various stages of project will also vary by site.  
The lifetime of the upper ground facilities will be 20 to 30 years under normal conditions. The 
lifetime of the production and injection wells will depend on seismic activity and forms a risk, 
109
especially as these wells form a very important share of the overall investment costs .

Barriers for the development and implementation of Geothermal 
Energy 
There are several reasons why, in the past, there has been little geothermal project initiation in 
the Caribbean region: 
 
1. The very small power demand in these nations;  
2. The very high, marginally economical cost of undertaking projects small enough to sell all 
their power to the local utilities, and  
3. The third problem is that there are few laws, regulations, or rules in place in these nations 
that will facilitate the licensing, permitting or creation of geothermal power sales 
agreements in the islands.  
4. Finally, there is little technical or legislative capacity on these islands and commonly, 
responsible capacity that has been built is lost due to administrative change and 
replacement of personnel. 
 
The variable (usually rising) costs of power caused by changing international oil prices have made 
even small sized geothermal developments more attractive. In, Nevis, Dominica, and St. Lucia 
there has been on-going work to clarify geothermal laws, rules and regulations. Most importantly, 
the successful 2008 drilling on Nevis and the 2013-2014 drilling on Dominica has attracted the 
attention of Multilateral Investment Banks and other international governmental entities whose 
financial and technical assistance may serve to decrease the perceived risks of early stage 
110
exploration and thus entice more private developers into the region .

Even before the 1995 eruptions, the southwestern flank of the Sufriere Hills volcano was the site 
of solfataric activity and of numerous thermal springs. There was also significant seismic activity 
along several well-developed fracture systems that transect the island.  
 
The UK Department for International Development initiated a number of studies and projects for 
the development of a 3 MW geothermal electricity generation facility at Montserrat. Activities 
started in 2010. The geothermal potential was studied prior to and following the most eruptive 
phase and this led to the drilling of two exploratory wells in excess of 2,350 meters deep by the 
Icelandic Drilling Company under contract of the UK Department for International Development. 
o
Temperatures of 298 C were recorded and present (2014) plans are to build a 3 MW power plant. 
Recently UK DfID funded phase 4 of this project with an additional amount of GBP 12.9 mln. Total 
costs of all four phases amounted to GBP 27.6 mln for all technical and economic studies, drilling 
of wells and realization of the electricity generation plant including grid connection. Total 
investments thus were US$ 23 million e.g. US$ 7,700 /kW. As most of the drilling has been 
completed, the location has been prepared including additional infrastructure like roads, cabling 
and site preparation, this price level seems to be a realistic estimate for geothermal development 
in the Caribbean (ref.3).  
 
For smaller facilities, the specific costs per kW will be somewhat higher, e.g. US$ 8,500 per kW.  
 
Nevis 
 
On Mt. Nevis’ northwestern, western and southwestern flanks, there are two solfataras (Farms 
and Cades), numerous thermal wells (Charlestown and Browns), and a large area of hydrothermal 
alteration (Belmont). Also, strong earthquakes with hypocenters very near Nevis occurred in 1951 
and 1961. The 1951 seismic event caused small fumarolic areas to develop in the Spring Hill 
Fault Zone in the northwest part of the island. There are encouraging geothermal indicia in at 
least 5 places on the island so that exploration should be focused and relatively inexpensive. 
(Huttrer, 1998). 
Based on the data acquired to date, the hydrothermal system on Nevis is believed to have the 
potential to support power generation of 45 MW, adequate to meet the demand of both Nevis and 
adjacent St. Kitts. The Commonwealth would then have the potential to become the first totally 
geothermally powered country in the world. In 2008, West Indies Power Company drilled three 
small diameter exploratory wells about 3.7 km apart, to depths ranging from 782 to 1,134 meters 
in the Spring Hill, Jessups, and Hamilton Estates areas. All three wells encountered temperatures 
0
in excess of 225 C and significant steam was produced. Geothermometric projections suggest 
0
reservoir temperatures of at least 260 C. (LaFleur and Hoag, 2010). 
In November 2013, Nevis Renewable Energy International was selected by the Nevis Island 
Administration to replace West Indies Power as the resource developer. This firm plans to build 
a 5-10 MW power plant to generate electricity for domestic use and, if possible, to export power 
to nearby St. Kitts. At this time, West Indies Power Company is challenging the right of the 
government to reassign the project.

A positive outcome of this analysis study will increase the PoS to about 70%, or demonstrate that 
geothermal energy is not a feasible option for renewable energy generation at Saba. The TNO 
cost estimate for a 2 MW geothermal power plant is € 10 million, € 5,000/kW. The TNO study 
includes all costs directly related to the geothermal power plant. 
 
In case a geothermal power plant would be operated for Saba only, the TNO report calculates the 
(levelized) costs at 0.23-0.30 euro / kWh.  
 
A combination with St. Eustatius would result in even higher costs per kWh due to the required 
sub-sea power cable, estimated at 27 mln Euros, and is not considered a viable option. 
 
A combination of Saba with St. Maarten could lead to a 31 MW power plant, according to the 
report. The sea-cable is estimated at 33 mln Euros. Taking advantage of the scale, this would 
112
result in far lower (levelized) costs of 0.11-0.15 euro/kWh . 
 
TNO prepared the cost estimate for the specific investments directly related to the development 
and realization of the geothermal power plant: slim and exploration well drilling, power plant 
construction etc. A number of other costs like site preparation, infrastructure development, 
environmental costs and grid connection costs were not mentioned. As the UK example for 
Montserrat shows, these costs may have a significant impact on overall realization. For the 
purposes of this study we estimate the realization costs for a 2 MW geothermal power plant to be 
higher, see next chapter. 
 
St. Eustatius (Statia) 
 
While some heat probably remains beneath The Quill as evidenced by reported occurrences of 
thermal water in two wells drilled for drinking water, there are no known hot springs or paleo-
thermal areas on the island (Huttrer, 1999). Geothermal development interest on Statia has not 
been evidenced in the past 5 years. 
 
According to the 2012 TNO study, the Quill shows no visible apparent fault zones like on Saba. It 
is very likely that they are covered by volcanic and marine deposits. The Quill on St. Eustatius is 
a young volcano and drilled water wells show some increased water temperatures towards the 
vent of this volcano. This suggests that infiltrated rainwater has been heated. As no detailed 
analysis of geothermal phenomena or natural seismicity data is available, this does not imply that 
there is no geothermal potential on St. Eustatius. Therefore, geothermal exploration is essential 
to further mature a business case. The most obvious area to explore for geothermal resources 
would be near the Quill.

Environmental impacts 
The realization of a geothermal power plant has a series of more and less significant 
environmental impacts during the different phases of preparation, drilling and operation. The most 
115
relevant environmental issues are summarized as follows : 
 
• Site preparatory work and infrastructure: transport activities and site clearing together with 
road enforcement. This will result in transport related emissions and wastes from 
infrastructure works; 
• Accidental discharge of drilling fluids and fuel: Drilling uses a number of chemicals and 
drilling fluids together with energy for which fuel tanks are installed. During drilling activities 
there will be risks of fluid and fuel spillages causing land contamination; 
• Well failure/upset condition: the drill contractor must prepare an Emergency Plan for the 
case of well failure and upset conditions. He must confirm full insurance for such events. 
• Drilling solid and fluid wastes: during drilling, solid and fluid wastes will be produced for 
which ponds will be realized at the drilling site. The contractor will have to ensure disposal 
of these wastes in accordance with environmental regulatory requirements. These wastes 
may contain heavy metals and toxic trace elements, especially when drilling in a volcanic 
area; 
• Groundwater: at certain depths, before reaching the target aquifer, groundwater will be 
reached. The contractor must ensure effective measures to prevent groundwater pollution; 
• Soil and land contamination from drilling lubricants and fuels: the contractor must prevent 
and/or minimize the risk of land contamination through different measures aimed at 
preventing any leakages and containment of possible spills; 
• Other impacts like, noise, GHG emissions, landscape and visual disturbance etc. 
 
The contractor will have to comply with environmental regulations and with international standards 
for this type of drilling and plant operational activities. An Environmental Impact Assessment will 
have to be prepared as soon as the site for the geothermal power plant has been identified. 
 
Compliance with the above requirements minimizing environmental impacts will induce additional 
investments costs.

Summary  
Based upon the above and analysis of all aforementioned sources, geothermal energy could be 
a feasible renewable source of energy for Saba with the following options and parameters. The 
table below presents the estimates for capital costs, including additional costs resulting from a 
number of issues relevant for the CN-islands as for many other similar islands and locations in 
the Caribbean: 
 
• No local availability of knowledgeable staff who could be involved in installation and 
operation and management of the geothermal-facility and power station. Specialized staff 
for drilling, installation and most of the operation and maintenance is not available at CN; 
• Problematic selection of locations, especially on Saba and St. Eustatius with limited land 
available for any type of installation. Locations will require more than average preparatory 
work to make it suitable for installation of drilling rigs and/or a geothermal facility; 
• As site location is difficult, it will in most cases not be found at an attractive location for 
grid connection. Additional grid connection costs must be taken into account as new 
cables will have to be laid with routing in difficult terrain; 
• Difficult and complex administrative and environmental procedures with insecure decision 
making. No procedures or requirements are in place for this type of installations which 
may result in relatively long term procedures.

This is the theoretical output in case of a constant capacity factor throughout the year. Given the demand profiles of Saba and St. 
  
Eustatius, the average capacity factor will be lower.

ANNEX 5: Factsheet OTEC 
 
The Technology  
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) technologies use the temperature difference 
between warm seawater at the surface of the ocean, and cold seawater at between 800–1000 
meters (m) depth to produce electricity. As OTEC installations generally operate with temperature 
differences of around 20°C or more, OTEC can only be applied in regions with high surface water 
temperatures, preferably over 25°C. Temperature levels at one kilometer depth are relative 
constant at about 4°C. 
Figure 1: regions with OTEC potential 
Figure 1 clearly shows that seawater temperatures in the Caribbean are sufficiently high to allow 
OTEC applications. Many Caribbean and Pacific islands have sea surface temperature of 25°C 
to 30°C. More specifically, most Caribbean and Pacific countries have the required temperature 
117
degrees at 1-10 km of their coastline . 
 
There are two main types of OTEC systems: 
 
1. Open Cycle OTEC 
Open Cycle OTES uses warmer surface water, which is introduced through a valve in a low-
pressure compartment, and flash evaporated. The vapor drives a generator and is condensed by 
the cold seawater pumped up from below. The condensed water can be collected and because it 
is fresh water, used for various purposes (figure 2). Additionally, the cold seawater pumped up 
                                                                 
117
 IRENA Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Technology Brief, 2014 (Ref.1) 
 129 

 
June 2016 
A variation of a Closed Cycle OTEC, called the Kalina Cycle, uses a mixture of water and 
ammonia. The use of ammonia as a working fluid reduces the size of the turbines and heat 
exchangers further. 
 
Other general components of the OTEC plant consist of the platform (which can be land-based, 
moored to the sea floor, or floating), the electricity cables to transfer electricity back to shore, and 
the water ducting systems. There is considerable experience with all these system components 
in the offshore industry. The technical challenge is the size of the water ducting systems that need 
to be deployed in large-scale OTEC plants. In particular, a 100 MW OTEC plant requires cold 
water pipes of yet to be constructed 10 m diameter or more and a length of 1000 m, which need 
to be securely connected to the platforms. Even 4-7 m diameter pipes needed for a 10MW plant 
still have to be demonstrated. 
 
Besides electricity production, OTEC plants can be used to support air-conditioning, seawater 
district cooling (SDC), or aquaculture purposes. OTEC plants can also produce fresh water. In 
Open-Cycle OTEC plants, fresh water can be obtained from the evaporated warm seawater after 
it has passed through the turbine. 
 
Another option is to combine power generation with the production of desalinated water. In this 
case, OTEC power production may be used to provide electricity for a reverse osmosis 
118
desalination plant. According to a study by Magesh , nearly 2.28 million litres of desalinated 
water can be obtained every day for every megawatt of power generated by a hybrid OTEC 
system (Magesh, 2010). 
 
 
Figure 4: Multi-functionality of OTEC facilities 
 
The potential multi functionality of an OTEC plant is shown in figure 4. Although 
additional products will support the business case, it will involve multiple sectors and 
119
thus increase complexity of decision-making and implementation .

June 2016 
installation costs of around $ 15,000–35,000/kW. OTEC plants in the 10-100 MW range are 
estimated to cost between $ 5,000-15,000/kW when installed. However, combined with the 
production of fresh water they could become economically viable for small island states or isolated 
communities (up to 100 000 residents), especially if OTEC resources are within 10 km of the 
121122
shore .  
 
The second parameter is the choice between open and closed cycle designs. Closed cycle 
designs are estimated to be slightly cheaper than open cycle designs. However, closed cycle 
installations do not produce potable water. Open cycle OTEC can provide an alternative for fresh 
water production based on reverse osmosis plants. 
 
A third parameter is the production of by-products. Water can be produced as a by-product, which 
increases the initial installation costs, but improves the overall economics for regions where fresh 
drinking water is valued. Also, large-scale OTEC plants can be combined with the production of 
energy-intensive products or energy carriers, like hydrogen, ammonia or methanol. 
 
A fourth parameter is the environmental conditions at the location where the cold water is 
extracted. On the one hand, the surface temperature gradient may be more beneficial off the 
coast, but would require either longer pipes (for an onshore plant) or longer subsea cables (for an 
offshore plant). 
 
Yearly maintenance cost are reported to be 1.4-2.7% of the initial investment. Given the state of 
development, 2.7% will be taken as a current reference. 
 
Few more recent financial figures are available as a reference. The aforementioned 105-kilowatt 
test project in Hawaii, which was installed in 2015, showed installation cost of approximately 
123
$48.000 /kW . 
 
The planned off-shore 10 MW OTEC plant in Martinique (see further), which was awarded a 72.3 
124
M€ subsidy as winner of the European program NER 300 , is announced by DCNS and Akuo 
energy to be built for (<) 300 M€. This equals approximately $33,000 per kW. The complementary 
onshore 5.7-megawatt Nautilus OTEC plant in Martinique is announced to cost about $ 32,000 
per kW, but will also provide cooling and fresh water.  
 
These numbers show that the investment costs are still substantial and do not show a (steep) 
decline as for other renewables. This relates to the development stage these technologies are 
still in.

OTEC economics in the Caribbean 
Today, only one project under implementation is known in the Caribbean region, which is the 
NEMO facility. NEMO is an ocean thermal energy project off the west coast of Martinique in the 
Caribbean Sea. A moored barge will be installed 
housing four turbo-generators. Each will be driven 
by an Ammonia closed Rankine cycle utilizing the 
circa 20°C temperature difference between the cold 
seawater at 1.1 km depth and the warm surface 
waters. The cold water is pumped via a single large 
diameter riser. Each turbine will produce roughly 4 
MW resulting in a total nominal installed capacity of 
16 MW with a maximum available capacity of 10.7 
MW. The net generated power is exported to the grid via a subsea cable and a substation at an 
existing conventional fossil fuel power plant. The overall investment costs of the NEMO plant are 
close to US$ 300 million. The project received a EU grant from the NER 300 program of € 72 
125
million . 
 
This project falls within the scope of the partnership agreement signed in January 2013 between 
DCNS and Akuo Energy to combine their respective skills with a view to marine renewable energy 
(MRE) developments.  
Furthermore, a low-power OTEC plant is planned to be installed on-shore to combine air-
conditioning, freshwater production and aquaculture solutions with electricity production by using 
deep-sea cold water. This NAUTILUS project will complement the NEMO offshore OTEC plant 
126
project. As published by Bloomberg , this 5.7-megawatt project at Bellefontaine in Martinique 
will cost about $183 million to build, which equals about $ 32,000 per kW. This facility will also 
provide fresh water and cooling capacity, which reduces the costs for electricity generation. There 
is insufficient information available concerning this project to assess the costs directly related to 
the electricity generation plant. 
 
The Dutch company Bluerise has developed a small pilot scale OTEC project at Curacao, at Hato 
airport. This installation will produce fresh water for an agricultural project, cold water for cooling 
of several buildings of the airport and in the direct neighborhood and produce electricity. Technical 
development is completed, the project is supported (not financially) by the Curacao government. 
Discussions on guarantees for the supply of cooling water are ongoing. As soon as this will be 
127
resolved, the project will be realized . 
 
In view of the above cost information, we estimate the investment costs for a 10 MW OTEC facility 
at US$ 300 million, e.g. US$ 30,000 per kW, with 2.7% of investment costs for the yearly O&M 
costs.

June 2016 
Summary  
Based upon the above and all sources analyzed (see last page), OTEC technologies energy 
cannot be regarded as a feasible renewable source of energy YET for the CN-islands as it is still 
in the development phase. The table below presents the estimates for OTEC capital costs.  
 
These costs include additional costs resulting from a number of issues relevant for the CN-islands 
as for many other similar islands and locations in the Caribbean: 
 
• No local availability of knowledgeable staff who could be involved in installation and 
operation and management of the OTEC-facility, specialized staff for installation and O&M 
is not available at CN; 
• Problematic selection of locations, especially on Saba and St. Eustatius with limited land 
available for any type of installation. Locations will require more than average preparatory 
work to make it suitable for installation of an OTEC facility. The direct coast line has high 
nature values and requires in depth investigation on the possibilities to install a cold water 
sea pipe. Around Saba and St. Eustatius offshore and onshore facilities must be hurricane 
resistant. Especially Bonaire has coral reefs all around the island; 
• As site location is difficult, it will in most cases not be found at an attractive location for 
grid connection. Additional grid connection costs must be taken into account as new 
cables will have to be laid with routing in difficult terrain; 
• Difficult and complex administrative procedures with insecure decision-making. No 
procedures are in place for this type of installations which may result in relatively long term 
procedures; 
• None of the islands have favorable locations for SWAC, as there are no or almost no 
buildings with a high cooling demand (large hotels, hospital, office buildings etc.). In case 
additional hotel accommodation is realized at the Plaza Bonaire area in the vicinity of 
Bonaire Airport, this could become a suitable location for an OTEC/SWAC facility; 
• The combination with fresh water production is possible on all three islands resulting in 
improved economics of the OTEC facility. 
 
Currently the following options and parameters apply: 
Parameters Small-scale Large-scale 
Capacity 2 MW 10 MW 100 MW 
Capacity factor  95% 95% 95% 
129
Yearly output in GWh/MW 8,3  8,3 8,3  
Lifetime 20 years 20 years 20 years 
Capital costs 41,000 $/kW 30,000$/kW 15,000 $/kW 
1,100 $/kW-yr 400 $/kW-yr 
Fixed O&M costs 800 $/kw 
Variable O&M costs -  - 
                                                                 
129 
This is the theoretical output in case of a constant capacity factor throughout the year. Given the demand profiles 
  
of Saba and St. Eustatius, the average capacity factor will be considerably lower.

ANNEX 6: Factsheet Wave and tidal Energy 
 
The Technology 
Tidal energy is a form of hydropower that 
converts the energy obtained from tides 
into useful forms of power, mainly 
electricity. Due to the consistent pattern of 
the moon’s orbit around the earth, the 
gravitational forces create motions or 
currents in the world's oceans. The 
temporary increases in sea level forces 
water from the middle of the ocean to 
move toward the shorelines, creating a 
tide. According to the general tide 
130
classification, The Caribbean has the lowest tide class of less than 2 meters (microtidal) . As a 
131
tidal range of at least 7 meters is required for economical operation , tidal energy is not regarded 
a feasible renewable source of energy for the CN-islands. 
 
Wave energy is the transport of energy by wind waves, and the capture of that energy to do 
useful work – for example, electricity generation, water desalination, or the pumping of water (into 
reservoirs). A machine able to exploit wave power is generally known as a wave energy converter 
(WEC). According to several studies, WEC technology can potentially extract 100GW of wave 
power worldwide. 
 
There is a wide range of wave energy technologies. Each technology uses different solutions to 
absorb energy from waves, and can be applied depending on the water depth and on the location 
(shoreline, near shore, off shore). 
 
Wave energy technologies consist of a number of components:  
 
• The structure and prime mover that captures the energy of the wave,  
• The foundation or mooring keeping the structure and prime mover in place,  
• The power take-off (PTO) system by which mechanical energy is converted into electrical 
energy, and  
• The control systems to safeguard and optimize performance in operating conditions. 
 
132
A common way of categorization of WEC installations is as follows :

Wave and Tidal energy worldwide 
Starting in the 1970s, the ocean energy technology has evolved to a phase where different 
concepts are being tested at a full scale, pre-demonstration phase, and commercial 
demonstrations are being deployed. In 2013, there were more than a hundred projects at various 
stages of development, but only a handful of technologies are close to commercialization. The 
wave energy devices being developed and tested today are highly diverse, and a variety of 
technologies have been proposed. Some of the more promising designs are undergoing 
demonstration testing at commercial scales. 
 
133
According to a 2015 report from the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) , 
ocean energy (still) faces four main bottlenecks: technology development, finance and markets, 
environmental and administrative issues, and grid issues. Technological barriers represent the 
most important challenge that the ocean energy sector needs to address in the short–medium 
term. Overcoming technology issues is key for ocean energy to become commercially viable; 
today public financial support is still needed for its development.  
The potential environmental impacts of ocean energy projects are not yet definitive due to the 
early stage of development of the technology, causing regulatory licensing issues. Last but not 
least, as ocean energy can only be harvested at specific locations, which are remote and not 
connected to the grid, grid extensions and enhancements needs to be taken into account. 
 
The JRC has identified 45 wave energy companies that have reached or are about to reach open-
sea deployment of their technologies. Most R&D dedicated to wave energy takes place in Europe, 
with the US and Australia also proving fertile grounds for the development of wave energy 
technologies. As the next figure shows, these areas have the highest wave power expressed in 
kW/m crest length, in contrast to the Caribbean. 
 
 
 
The global installed capacity of wave energy remains low. Most leading wave technologies are 
still at an advanced R&D stage, and only a few machines have sustained long operational hours. 
Wave energy technologies and markets still have much to prove on their path to commercial 
viability. The costs of wave energy are therefore considerably higher than other renewables and 
are only expected to drop substantially over many years, if and only if the technology matures.

Summary 
Based upon the above and analysis of all aforementioned sources, both tidal and wave energy 
cannot be regarded as a feasible and favorite renewable source of energy for the CN-islands.

ANNEX 7: Case studies  
An increasing number of relatively small islands with decentralized electricity grids move forward 
with renewables. In most cases small island grids and their production facilities are vulnerable 
and depend fully on expensive fuels like gasoil. On the other hand, as islands are small, they can 
be changed relatively easily, quite often with financial help of the parent country and/or financial 
institutions.  
 
Throughout the past couple of years, several news items have been established on islands “going 
green”. Often high numbers are stated, even up to a 100%, although actual electricity production 
by renewables is often confused with for instance penetration of renewables in term of capacity, 
not taking into account the actual capacity factor. 
 
Part of this assignment a selection of green islands has been analyzed based upon publically 
available information. The highlights are stated in the following table:

The references presented below provide more detailed information in order to understand even 
better the characteristics of the examples given. The main findings from the analyses are as 
follows:  
 
- All islands are different with regards to size, demand, supply, natural resources, et cetera. 
There is no single solution when looking at implementing renewables in island grid; 
- The main challenge is not so much financing as these examples were mainly financed 
externally, but the technology to balance demand and supply. Batteries, water storage 
and flywheel but also smart grids and demand management are examples of technologies 
used to guarantee a reliable power supply.
