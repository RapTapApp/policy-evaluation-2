Woord vooraf
De ongekend snelle achteruitgang van de biodiversiteit vormt een minstens even grote bedreiging voor 
de mensheid als de opwarming van de aarde, zo stelt IPBES (The International Science-Policy Platform 
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) in haar rapport ‘First Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services’. Biodiversiteit (een samenvoeging van ‘biologisch’ en ‘diversiteit’) is een 
samenvattend begrip voor de totale rijkdom aan leven op aarde van het niveau van genen en planten- 
en diersoorten tot aan complete ecosystemen. Biodiversiteit gaat op wereldniveau hard achteruit als 
gevolg van destructief landgebruik, klimaatv erandering, overbevissing, vervuiling en invasieve soorten. 
Zonder ingrijpende maatregelen zullen tussen de 500.000 en een miljoen planten- en diersoorten de  
komende decennia uitsterven. Dit terwijl biodiversiteit, en natuur in brede zin, talloze diensten en 
producten leveren aan maatschappij en economie en als zodanig onmisbaar zijn voor het menselijk 
bestaan op aarde. Het IPBES-rapport is een wetenschappelijke analyse van de toestand van de natuur 
en biodiversiteit op wereldniveau en is de wetenschappelijke basis voor een nieuw biodiversiteitsverdrag 
dat in 2020 moet worden afgesloten door de 132 lidstaten en partijen van de VN-Conventie over 
Biodiversiteit (CBD) uit 1992, de tegenhanger van het VN-klimaatverdrag uit datzelfde jaar. 
Is de achteruitgang van biodiversiteit ook zo groot in Nederland? Wat doet Nederland om het 
biodiversiteits verlies te stoppen en hoe effectief is dat? Naast het IPBES-rapport van de Verenigde 
Naties hebben de partijen ook zelf een rapportage van de toestand van de natuur en biodiversiteit op 
nationaal niveau opgesteld voor de CBD. Het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit heeft 
deze rapportage daarnaast op 12 juli 2019 ook naar de Tweede Kamer gestuurd. De tekst van deze 
nationale rapportage, samengesteld door Wageningen Environmental Research, heeft in dit WOt-
technical report een beter leesbare indeling en een aantrekk elijke opmaak gekregen.

Samenvatting
Het Verdrag inzake biologische diversiteit (Convention on Natuur en biodiversiteit in Europees Nederland
Biological Diversity, CBD) is een internationaal verdrag, 
geïnitieerd door het Milieuprogramma van de Verenigde Nederland is een van de dichtstbevolkte landen ter wereld 
Naties (UNEP). De CBD zet in op drie doelen: het behoud en het grootste deel van het landoppervlak is zeer produc-

gebieden in Nederland (Natuurnetwerk Nederland incl. 
Natura 2000) goed voor meer dan 17% (= doelstelling) 
van het land- en binnenwatergebied en 10% van de 
kust- en zeegebieden, maar is het Aichi-doel nog niet 
bereikt omdat de milieuomstandigheden een aanzienlijk 
negatief effect hebben op de staat van instandhouding van 
deze beschermde gebieden. Vermeldenswaard is dat het 
verzamelen, delen en toepassen van kennis over biodiver-
siteit (Aichi-target: Knowledge improved, shared and 
applied) zeer goed ontwikkeld is in Nederland waardoor dit 
doel al ruim voor 2020 is bereikt.
Natuur en biodiversiteit op de Nederlandse 
Caribische eilanden
Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden omvat ook zes Caribische 
eilanden (Caribisch Nederland met daarbinnen de drie 
eilanden Bonaire, Saba en St. Eustatius en de drie zelf-
standige landen binnen het Koninkrijk: Curaçao, Aruba en 
St. Maarten), die onderdeel zijn van de Caribische 
Biodiversiteitshotspot. Hier komen habitats voor variërend 
van tropisch nevelbos en zoutmeren tot mangrovebossen 
en koraalriffen, die het leefgebied vormen van honderden 
endemische en bedreigde soorten. De ecosystemen van 
de eilanden zijn kwetsbaar. De meeste habitats zijn klein, 
net als de soortenpopulaties die ervan afhankelijk zijn, 
terwijl de bedreigingen groot zijn. 
Data van langetermijnmonitoring zijn schaars en dat geldt 
ook voor trendanalyses en indicatoren. De Aichi-doelen 
zijn daarom, voor elk eiland afzonderlijk, vooral beoor-
deeld op basis van (lokale) expert-kennis. De eilanden van 
Caribisch Nederland staan er wat beter voor dan de 
andere drie eilanden, maar over het algemeen liggen de 
Aichi-biodiversiteitsdoelen niet op schema. Soms is zelfs 
sprake van een achteruitgang. Dit komt door de vele 
lokale bedreigingen, zoals overbegrazing en erosie als 
gevolg van duizenden loslopende geiten en ander vee, 
vervuiling, invasieve exoten en overbevissing. De eco-
systemen hebben daardoor ook minder veerkracht om de 
verwachte negatieve gevolgen van klimaatverandering op 
te kunnen vangen. De acties om de verschillende bedrei-
gingen het hoofd te bieden, zijn nog onvoldoende om in 
2020 de Aichi-biodiversiteitsdoelen te behalen. Uiteindelijk 
zal dit ook de eilandeconomieën raken, omdat deze (met 
name de sectoren toerisme en visserij) sterk afhankelijk 
zijn van ecosysteemdiensten.

‘Progress towards target’ means, according to the CBD, that “significant progress towards the attainment of the 
target has been made. The progress could take the form of measures being taken or actual improvements in the 
status of the issues being addressed. However, while this category indicates an improving situation, the progress 
that has been made will be insufficient for the target to be met by the deadline (=2020) unless further measures 
are taken.”

Sint Maarten has not yet published a list of protected flora

and are probably extinct. The West Indian manatee can no 
longer maintain itself and, crucially, cannot use the

many years ago. The introduction of the mongoose has 
led to a decline in land birds and probably to the extinc-

Antillean iguana is probably extinct, or at best genetically 
degraded by the introduction of the green iguana. The loss 
of terrestrial biodiversity is likely to continue due to 
habitat loss and the effects of introduced species.

Dutch contribution to the achievement of 
Aichi Targets 12 at a global level
The conservation of species depends also on international 
cooperation on measures such as the establishment of an 
MPA in the Sargasso sea, the nursery ground of European 
eel, and the defragmentation of rivers to allow migratory 
fish species like Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon to 
reach their nursery grounds. The Netherlands has agreed 
to partially open several sluices in the Haringvlietdam, 
which closes off one of the main sea arms in the estuary 
of the rivers Meuse and Rhine. This decision (Kierbesluit) 
was agreed in 2011 and the measures will be finalised in 
2018. Another example of international cooperation is the 
prevention of the extinction of the fire salamander 
(Salamandra salamandra) in the Netherlands after a 
fungal infection nearly killed the entire national 
population.
