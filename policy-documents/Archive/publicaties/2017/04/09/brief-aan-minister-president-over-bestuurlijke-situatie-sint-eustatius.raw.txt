Subject: conflict of legislation and measures of the Government of the Netherlands with
articles 73 and 103 of the United Nations Charter, UN resolutions 742(VIII), 945, and
1514, and article 93 of the Constitution of the Netherlands
Excellency!
On January 4th, 2017, a letterwith reference number 0001/17, was dispatched to you by the
Executive Council of Sint Eustatius, including a copy of a related motion of the Island Council of
Sint Eustatius of November 30th, 2016. Said letter contained a formal petition to stopthe
process of permanently embedding Sint Eustatius in the Dutch constitution.
As far as Ihave been informed,the Executive Council has not received any replyfrom you as yet.
In a letter to the Executive Council dated February 27lh, 2017,the minister of the Interior and
Kingdom Relations did indicate that he expected to respond to the ExecutiveCouncil's letter to
you ofJanuary 4th, 2017, "within a few weeks". Since then, and without said answer having been
received by the Executive Council, both you and the minister of the Interior and Kingdom
Relations presented the draft legislation for said embedding of Sint Eustatius in the Dutch
constitutionto the newly elected Dutch Parliament on March 23rd, 2017. This appears to be a
clear indication that the petition of January 4th, 2017 has been ignored.
The Dutch Parliament also requested you to inform them about the content of the Executive
Council's letter, and your reply to it, no later than February 14th, 2017. As far as Ihave been able
to determine, this information has not been provided to the Dutch Parliament.
Meanwhile, as proposed by the Executive Council in a letter dated March 14th, 2017, a process
of dialogue between the Executive Council and the Government of the Netherlands is being

ST. EUSTATIUS
CARIBISCH NEDERLAND
Iam ofthe opinion that the Kingdom Charter isan international agreement based on UN
resolution 742 (VIM) of November 27th, 1953. The Kingdom Charter was submitted to the
Secretary General ofthe United Nations on March 30th, 1955, by the Government of the
Netherlands, and thus registered as a treaty in accordance with article 102 of the Charter.
Based on Sint Eustatius' rightto a "full measure of self-government" as laid out inthe UN
Charter and relevant UN resolutions, certain planned andenacted legislation (e.g. the WolBES,
andthe draft legislation to permantently embed Sint Eustatius into the Dutch Constitution), as
well as measures (e.g. the preliminary supervision and other typesof unlawful interference of
the minister ofthe Interior and Kingdom Relations in the internal affairs ofSint Eustatius)
imposed on the Governmentand people of Sint Eustatius bythe Government of the
Netherlands as ofOctober 10th, 2010, clearly manifest an intrinsic inconsistency orconflict with
the UN Charter and relevant UN resolutions.
Because of this, the Government ofSint Eustatius has startedto make use ofthe opportunity
provided by the Uruguayan and Indian amendments to UN Resolution 945 as far back as 2011.
The Government ofthe Netherlands is well aware ofthis conflict, as itwas the main topic of
debateat the United Nations at the time, andthe main reason why India and Uruguay
submitted theiramendments which wereconsequently approved by the General Assembly.
There can therefore be no discussion about the nullity ofsaid planned and enacted legislation
and actions by the Government ofthe Netherlands when they conflict with Sint Eustatius' right
to a "full measure of self-government".
In such an event, article 103of the Charterdictatesthat the obligations underthe charter shall
prevail, and article 93ofthe Dutch constitution confirms such. Since this concerns the obligation
of the Government of the Netherlands to ensurea "full measure of self-government", there is
no room fordiscretion in thismatter. Obligations under the UN Charter are peremptory.
In addition, UN resolution 742 containsthe following under consideration # 6 "....association
with another State orgroup ofStates ifthis isdone freely and on the basis of absolute equality."
The legislation enacted (and planned), and the measures imposed by the Government ofthe
Netherlands since October 10th, 2010 are also in conflict with this resolution, as under "absolute
equality" one party cannotsubmit the other to any measures, and any provision forsameisipso
facto unenforceable. Measures such asthose envisioned by said enacted (and planned)
legislation and measures can have no place in a relationship of absolute equality. They, or any
other provision which conflicts with Sint Eustatius' right to "a full measure of self-government"
