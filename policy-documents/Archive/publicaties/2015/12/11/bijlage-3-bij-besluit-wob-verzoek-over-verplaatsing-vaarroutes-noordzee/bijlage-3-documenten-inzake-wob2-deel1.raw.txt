MOTIE VAN HET LID VAN
VELDHOVEN
Voorgesteld tijdens het Notaoverleg
van 13 december2010
De Kamer,
gehoord de beraadstaging,
constaterende, dat naar verwachting slechts drie van de twaalf uitgegeven vergunningen
voor
windenergieparken op
zee zullen worden gebruikt als gevolg van de uitkomsten van de
tender in
verband met Ronde 2 windenergie op zee;
overwegende, dat de bedrijven die meegedaan hebben aan de tenderprocedure geld en tijd
hebben gestopt in de voorbereidingen voor de vergunningaanvraag, wat verloren
dreigt te gaan
wanneer deze vergunningen verlopen;
verzoekt de regering om de levensduur van de vergunningen in kwestie te verlengen 2020
tot en
deze verhandelbaar te maken tussen marktpartijen,
en gaat over tot de orde van de dag.

Geachte leden van
het IDON,
Via deze memo informeer ik u over de
stand van zaken omtrent de uitvoering van de
Motie Van Veidhoven en vraag ik uw instemming
op de concept-brief hieromtrent
aan de
Kamer.
Zoals u in de concept-brief aan de Kamer en aanbiedingsnota
de voor staatssecretaris
Atsma kunt lezen,
Afstemming wind-mijnbouw
Vervolg Hollandse Kust (en gesprekken
met scheepvaartsector 2 nm)
Afstemming routewijzigingen voor indiening IMO

De gesprekken tussen vergunninghouders, scheepvaartsector
en Rijkswaterstaat hebben geleid
tot een gezamenlijk
hoofdlijnenakkoord over de uitvoering van de motie
(bekrachtigd op 13 juli ji). In de afgelopen maanden is deze
aanpak
getoetst op juridische en
scheepvaartveiligheidsaspecten
en op andere belangen zoals
mijnbouw, visserij, natuurbelangen. Het resultaat is een breed
gedragen ruimtelijke oplossing en bestaat uit het behouden
vergunningen,
van de het verplaatsen van de vergunning
“Scheveningen-Buiten” naar een
andere vergunning van
Eneco en het verleggen van de scheepvaartroutes. Mocht in de
periode tot 2020 duidelijk worden dat de vergunde parken om
bedrijfseconomische redenen
door de windsector toch niet
worden gebouwd, heeft mogelijkheid de

vergunningen in te trekken. Hiermee wordt voorkomen dat de
ruimteclaims, wanneer deze niet benut worden, ander gebruik

Tweede Kamer hierover op 31 januari geïnformeerd.

Doordat de olie uit het wrak en de pijpleiding is verwijderd, is
ook het ecologisch risico aanzienlijk

not always consistent with the design and availability of modern displays embecided

is for the exeharige of information
only and does not provide any additional authority

mandating changes in the vessel’s operations. The reporting system will be
implemented consistent with UNCLOS, SOLAS and other relevant international

moblle band
1
IMO would like to thank
ITU-R Wp 58 for the liaison statement contained
as in
annex 30 to document
5B)62, sent in June 2012, requesting IMO’s
Sub-Committee on
Safety of Navigation (NAV)
to consider the proposed
amendments to Recommendation
ITU-R
M.1371-4.
2
The NAV
Sub-Committee, at its fifty-eighth session
from 2 to 6 July 2012,
considered the
liaison statement and agreed to inform
ITU-R WP 5B as follows.
3 With regard to the
proposed changes in annex 1, paragraph
2.1.6 concerning
AIS-SART station, NAV
the Sub-Committee considered MOB
that and EPIRB-AIS devices
shoiild not
be subsets of Af S-SART. This
is because these devices do not conform with all
the requirements
and
characteristics of an AIS-SART, for instarice, battery life, etc.
It was
further noted that other devices
than AIS-SART are not considered be locating
to devices
under the GMDSS.
Therefore, the Sub-Cornmittee
suggests that paragraphs 2.1.6.1 and 2,1.6.2 should
be
renumbered as new headings
such as 2.1.7 Man overboard devices
(MOB) and 2.1.8.
Emergency position
indicating radio beacon — automatic identification
system (EPIRB-AIS).
The
Sub-Committee further suggests
that the description of these devices should not
refer to
an integrated AIS-SART
transmitter but to a device using burst transmissions as
described in
annex 9 of the Recommendation.
4 The Sub-Committee discussed
again the navigational status parameters
in annex 8,
table 46 (existing Table 45).
The
Sub-Committee concurred with the
proposal to revise the definitions of the navigational
status parameters 11 and 12 for regional
use as follows:
- Parameter 11 to “power-driven vessel
towing astern” and;
- Parameter 12 to “power-driven
vessel pushing ahead or towing alongside”.
In considering
the term “regional use”, the Sub-Committee
was of the uncierstanding that
visiting ships would not be required to use
these navigational status parameters and that
the
relevant national maritime Authority would
inform shipping about the use and interpretation
of
these parameters
when in use.
The Sub-Committee did not
concur with the proposal to define navigational
status
parameter 13 to “requiring assistance”
for regional use. This is because
distress alerting
using AlS has been
not yet developed and is under consideration
in reviewing the GMDSS.
The Sub-Committee concurred with the
proposed changes to the description of navigational
status parameters 14 and 15
to be extended to include MOB and EPIRB-AIS.

Objectives
This FSA Is used as a taal to help in the evaluatlon of the new spatial plans In the Dutch EEZ, i.e.
measures. Objectives of
the IMO variant, in pafticular the proposal for the review of ships routeing
the FSA are twofold. First, to identify and lmprove a number of shortcomings In the present
shipping route system from e purely nautical point of view. Second, to optimize spatial planning at
shipping within close proximity to
the North Sea by facilitating safe and efficlent navigatlon to
existing future wind farms gas Installations and the safety and protection of these
and and all and
assets themselves.
Baseline scenarios
The (quantitative) QRA and the (qualitatlve) FSA/HAZID assessment consider and compare three
windfarms and proposed
spatial “varlants”, The new “IMO Variant” all so-called round 2

Resuits of risk and safety assessments
Both QRA and FSA/HAZID come to the conclusion that the IMO variant Is the safest variant of the

This
Introductive chapter serves to make the reader acquainted wlth the history, context, motives,
objectives and
methods of the Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) and wlth the structure of this
report, In whlch the FSA process is documented.
1.1. Contributors to the FSA
In order to arrive at a widely supported and thoroughly Formal
argumented Safety Assessment, the
FSA process
has seen the invoivement of a number of organisatlons. This cover report hereafter
referred to as “FSA cover report” has been
drafted by Arcadis (UK) and the Dutch Ministry of
Infrastructure and the Envlronrnent (the competent authority in
representing the Netheriands
IMO). The
report summarizes and Interprets the resuits of three separate assessments: a
qualitative PSA (a FSA/HAZID assessment based on
expert judgement), a Quantitative Risk
Analysis (QRA) and a Munitions Risk Analysis (MRA). These three were commissioned
assessments
by the Dutch Ministry of
Infrastructure and the Environment and the Port of Rotterdam, after
consuitatlon with the Port Amsterdam
of and a Consortium of wind farm developers. The three
assessments
were undertaken by Arcadis (UK), Marin and TNO respectively.

Figure 1 FSA steps
1.5 FSA organisation
The FSA has been carried out along three separate, largely parallel paths, which have culminated in
this one report (see also Figure 2):
1) A qualitatlvely based FSA
The study is underteken by Arcadis (UK) and named “Formal Safety Assessment, a qualitative risk
assessment the proposed the
for route structure In the !Jorth Sea’ The study addresses all steps of
FSA method, Its risk FSA/HAZID
assessment part is based on expert judgement according to the
method. The report is inciuded as Appendix 1; the results of the study are integraliy discussed in
this cover report.
The study is hereafter referred to as “FSA/HAZID”.
2) A Quantitative Ri5k Assessment (QRA)
The study
Is undertaken by the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) and named
“Quantitative Risk Assessment for the proposed route structure in the North Sea”. The QRA
addresses step 2 of the FSA method and complements the expert judgement of FSA/I-IAZID
assessment Appendix 2;
to Jointly form the basis of the Risk Assessment. The report Is inciuded as
the results of the study are integrally dlscussed in thIs cove report. Is hereafter referred
The study
to as “QRA”.
3) A Munitions Risk Assessment of Sea shipping routes with regard to
(MRA) North
munitlons dump sites
During Holland
the hazard identification phase, two ammunition dumps off Ijmuiden and Hook of
were ideritified as potential nearby shipping routes, The
hazards In relation to the proposed
Netherlands Organisation for Appiled Scientific Research (TNO), a research institute speciallsed in
the subject matter on the sites. The
of munitlons, was asked to carry out a separate risk analysis
study addresses ammurlition-specific aspects of 2, 3 and 5 of the FSA method:
step
• to provide an objective assessment of the absolute and relative rlsks in the vicinity of the
dump sites;
• to assess the effect of risk mitigating measures on risk levels; and
• to provide a decision making basis for the design of routelng measures and other risk
mitlgating measures
in the vicinity of the dump sites.

Cover report on the (formal)
eatety assesemerits for 26 maart 2012
2.
This chapter presents the
baseHnes following from the FSA 2010, that served points of
as
departure for the current FSA (paragraph
2,1) The resulting varlants and situations that are
actually considered
in this FSA study report are presented
in paragraph 2.2.
2.1
Outline and resuits of the previous
Navigational Review: FSA2O1O
The 2010 Navigatlonal Risk af
Review Wind Park development In Dutch waters 259-7051
(Ref HZ
01,
lSth October 2010, “FSA2O1O”) considered six
(6) Variants as follows:
• Variant 2A
• Variant 3A
• Variant 4A
•
Variant 5A
• Variant 6A
• Wadden Noord
The study concluded that
the Variants 3A & 6A have the iowest risk-score in terms of navigational
risk.
These two varlants therefore form the basis for
the currentiy proposed IMO Variant,
The Dutch Administration and stakehoiders
the involved in the Consultative Committee on Water
and the
North Sea (Overlegorgaan Water
en Noordzee) conciuded that the design of a traffic
separation
scheme and an anchorage area near IJmuiden
are no regret measures In reiation to all
developed variants for potentiai
wind areas off the Dutch coast. They also conciuded that
the traffic
situatlon around the Horizon platform, where
many different traffic fiows converge, can be
improved
by separating and diverting traffic fiows. The paragraphs
below address the various
factors that iead to these conclusions
in more detail.
Near misses
In 2009 the Port of Amsterdam
conducted a survey about the safety situation cm roads to
the
Ijmuiden.
This research revealed some
undesirable safety situations that need improvement.
Especially
the vessel traf’fic services of Ijmuiden mentions near
frequent misses. These near misses
occur in the approach area
of IJmuiden, particuiarly between km 23 and km 43 of IJ-channei.
the
In that area a number of traffic fiows cross
each other in a north-south direction to and from Maas
North TSS
with traffic to and from Ijmuiden.
More tankers
The study also
showeci that the number of shlps on the routes of
Ijmuiden which need to anchor,
has grown. This trend has continued
after the economic crIsis. ThIs is due to the substantiai
increase in storage, blending and handling in
of gasoline the port of Amsterdam and the
commissioning
of the Vopak terminal in 2011, Because the availabie anchoring
area is regularly
full, ships move to other places
at sea. This often creates dangerous situations because
sometimes
ships
are anchoring neer traffic routes, where
they are not expected.
Undesirable situation Horizon
at Platform
The FSA2O1O conciuded that the number of
traffic Ilows around the Horizon Platform increases
risks to the platform.
Neer the platform traffic flows In varlous directions are
crossing and passing
eech other. That makes the situation
traffic complex and Is of high risk. The operator of the
piatform confirms this. He noted that the Is
safety zone lncreasingly violated. This is an undesirabie
situation.
Condusion
Therefore, FSA2O1O
the conciuded that the lmplementation of a new traffic
separation schema in
the approaches to Ijn,uiden and en additlonai
anchor area could improve safety. This is the case,
especially because
the shipping is better reguiated. It would also necessitate
shifting Maas North
TSS to the West rerouting
and traffic from Texel to Schouwenbank.

consideration and the assets. Greater control and lnfluence of VTS should be a
mitlgating factor and a
fact finding vlsit to the VTS station confirmed the need for this
additlonal control.
2. The Neer misses in the approaches to Ijmuiden are disturbing In that all the incidents relate
to the mlsinterpretation and/or understandlng of the Coilislon Regulations. The situatlon for
the
approaches to Ijmuiden can be lmproved by:
• deslgnation of a TSS;
• better utilization of the VTS of the competent authority at Ijmuiden (CNB), giving
them greater control and
authority; in addition to
• repositioning of the existing anchorage
areas.
3. It Is dear that the
Dutch government is proactive In thelr commltment and support to Wind
Parks as a form of sustainable energy. However, this commitment and progress must be
mime wlth an established safety regime.
4. The existing farms, OWEZ and PAWP have froved successful which has laid a firm
foundation
for the encouragement for further exploration which is evidenced In the 12
licensed wind farms under consideration,
5. The trend Is up with dear optimism from Amsterdam Port which hes maintained its position
in the fourth piece of European
ports. Tanker traffic Is clearly on the lncrease and measures
must be in place to address this trend.
6. Major Is
concern registered at the apparent Indifterence to the safety zones around
windfarm and 011/gas assets. A 72% increase In vlolations of Safety Zones In 2010 over
2009
is a disturbing statistic.

QRA Calcutation Results
Table 1 shows calculated ilkelihoods and for considered ships’
costs each variant of wind farn and
routeing configuration. The left part of Table 1 contains the probabilities that a wind turbine is lost.
The center part of the table contains the yearly costs of accidents with the wind farm and of
accldents and extra miles
outside the wind farm. By comparing the columns, t becomes dear that
the largest contribution of the yeariy costs is deilvered by costs of the extra miles. Thereafter, the
damage to the wind turbines gives the largest contribution.
Only the proposed route structure reduces the number of shipping incidents. The extra ncidents

wlth the wind farms are completely compensated by the decrease of 0,283 incidents outside
the wind farms. In summary, 0,076 less incldents will incident

the results of a base variant. The
resuits in case the wind farms licensed in round 2 are built, are

routeing measures. The following
conclusions can be
drawn.
The
proposed route structure is the best option with respect
to safety. k is the only variant for

of incldents with shipplng will decrease,
The main
impacts ori safety by the proposed route structure follows:

• 0,153 ships will be Involved In a collision.
The lncrease Is mainly caused by an

number of overtaking collisions, and by the higher concentratlon of

The summation of all
Incidents outside the wind farrns delivers a change -0.283 incldents

shipping per year, thus
on average 1 incident less in 3.5 years.
Much
of the profit of 0.283 fewer lncidents outside the wind Is offset by ramming
and driftirig
contacts wlth the wind turbines.
When all the wind farms are built 0.206 contacts wlth wind
turbines are expected, Then In total 0.076 fewer lncidents
are expected, thus on average 1 incident
less
in 13 years,
The impact on the probablilties of a
contact against a platform fluctuates strorigly. The rlsks for
some
platforms decrease, for example for the platforms Horizon
and P18, whlle the risks for other
platforms Increase, The
collislon risk for Horizon due to a route-bound shlp decreases by 25%.
Despite this reduction, Horizon remains platform
the w)th the highest collision risk. In total, a sllght
reduction of
in risk 0,008 incidents per year for platforms is achieved.
The largest contribution of the total
yearly extra costs is delivered by the costs of the extra mlles.
These amount
costs MC 19.3 per year.
In case all wind farms licensed In round
2 are built, the probablilty of a contact wlth a wind turbine
will
amount to 0,0592 per year for rammirig and 0,1363 for drifting additlonal

Implemented east of the
main route from North Hinder to Texel T5S. In case of the proposed route
structure Is implemented the ramming risk will
amount 0,0037 per year and the drifting risk
0,1155
per year, thus an lmprovenient factor of respectively 16 for rarnming and
1.18 for drifting.
The collision risk of wind turbines
by non-route-bound ships remains the same, because their
behaviour is not affected by the proposed route structure,
The extra lncldents In
case the wInd farms are built are less than the lncldents saved by the
introduction of the proposed route structure.
The three new anchorage
areas near IJmuiden within the proposed route structure are safer than
the existing anchorage area on the north side, because
the lane wlth outgoing traffic from
Ijmuiden to be
has crossed twice. The enchorage area NW will not be used initially but comes Into
use when there is a need to. The
anchoring near IJmuiden will become safer for the proposed route
structure than in the present 5ituation.

Summary
The Dutch
Ministry of lnfrastructure and Environment (Rijkswaterstaat) has
advanced plans for adjustment of the current
traffic lanes for shipping on the North
Sea. On their request TNO has undertaken an assessment of the risks of ship
traffic
across or near the munition dump sites off IJmuiden
and Hook of Holland.
Scope of the risk assessment
The risk
assessment:
• Is performed for:
— The present route structure;
— The proposed route structure
in which the dumping areas off Hook of Holland
will be located in the separation zone of the Maas North Traffic
Separation
Scheme (TSS);
— The
alternative route structure with the dumping areas off Hook of Holland
located northbound lane
in the of the TSS:
• Is based on the following incident scenarios:
— ship sinks;
— ship anchors;
— drifter drags anchor;
— fishing baat drags bottom trawling gear;
— ship loses container or
other deck cargo;
— vibration of ship movement disturbs seabed;
— water turbulence due to propeller
wash disturbs seabed;
— ship strikes seabed with keel or propeller;
• Incorporates:
— fishing
boats,
— small category container
to largest ships;
— ships with polluting cargo (oil, chemicals);
— ships with explosive cargo (gasoline, LPG);
• Is limited by ships with a maximum draught of 15 m, which relates to the water
depths in the area.
Desk study and input
Since both the likelihood and effects of an underwater detonation depend on
the
amount and types of dumped munition
and the applied dumping methods, the latter
are of prime importance to the risk assessment. For this reason, a
comprehensive
search was performed the archives
of of the Netherlands Institute for Military
History
(NIMH), the Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit of the Ministry of Defence
(EODD), the Archives
National and several other sources. This survey shows that:
• 30,000 and 20,000 tons of munition have been dumped at IJmuiden and
Haak
of Holland respectively (conservative
estimate);
• The dump sites are likely to consist for the greater part of munition for fire
arms
of all calibres. Fuzed
munitions may be present. Aircraft bombs are unhikely to
have been dumped in large numbers. Mines, sea mines, depth charges and
torpedoes were dumped,
not or have been dumped in very small numbers.
Chemical weapons are very unlikely to have been dumped;

Deliverables and
rationale of risk
The purpose of the risk analyses
is to determine whether the safety of shipping in
area
the of the munition dumps could be hazardous, to recommend
appropriate risk
mitigating measures and these
to relate measures to corresponding levels of risk.
The overall likelihood and effects are therefore assessed
and compared for the
above mentioned different structure
route scenarios, incident scenarios and a
number
of risk mitigating policies.
Recommended risk mitigating
measures
The risk analyses have lead
TNO to recommend the following risk mitigation
measures for the dump sites off Ijmuiden and Hook of
Holland (or similar nautical
meas u res):
•
Selection of the “proposed route struöture”;
• The munition dump areas should
be clearly marked out by buoys with relevant
indications;
• The munition dump areas should
be clearly marked on nautical charts as
ProhibitedAreas
for ships with explosive cargo and with
vessels a draught of
more than 15m and RestrictedAreas
for all other ships. Within the restricted
area,
anchoring, bottom trawling, dredging or any other underwater
operation
should be prohibited as
a minimum;
• Continuous surveillance of the dump areas advised
is to verify whether ships
are in compliance with regulations.
Overview of risk resuits
The risk assessment including the mitigating
measures is given in Table i for the
three route structures.
The residual risks are comparable for the present and
proposed route structure and largely identified
as ‘low” and very low”. The risk for
ships carrying explosives
is identified as “moderate”. In contrast, the risks
are
classified up to the high” level for the alternative
route structure.
It is concluded that with the implementation aforementioned
of the mitigating
measures,
the risks for the present and proposed route structures are (presumably)
acceptable. Attention is indicated to guarantee
that ships with explosive cargo stay
away from
the dump areas. Note that the recommended measures are
a
consolidation and extension of the “restricted
areas” that are presently already
indicated
above the munition dump sites on the nautical charts.

Loading of the vessels
with munition was performed by German prisoners of war
under British command and facilitated by loading cranes. It
is anticipated that the
coasters carried loading
cranes themselves (corroborated by [Ruis, 2011]).
Dumping at Hook of Holland was also performed using amphibious
assault ships or
Landing Craft Tanks (LCTs)
that were loaded with munitions in Hook of Holland and
Vlissingen. Between September 1945 and June 1946 approximately
10,000 tons of
munitions were dumped at the site
off Hook of Holland.
Figure 1 Loading of LCT with munition for dumping in the North Sea [Foundation
Historical
Archive EDDI.
2.1.2 Dumping under Dutch
authority (1946-1947)
As the clearing and dumping
progress was slow, it was decided on February 9 1946
that
responsibility for clearing of the remaining 80,000 to 100,000 tons of
mainly
German munition was shifted to
the Ministers of Navy and War. To mitigate the risk
for
the population it was decided to upgrade the work to the highest
rate possible.
Regulations dictated dump all munition
to that was safe for transport and not
suitable
for reuse. The remaining munition was destructed, preferably in
situ, ie.
blown in place. Before transport to
the designated harbours, munition was first
collected
at munition depots like Noordertocht. At these locations munitions that
could be (partially) were
reused set apart for further treatment at the Artillerie
Inrichtingen
at Zaandam and the Explosives Factory in Muiden. Transportation
was
performed under authority of the Dutch
land forces. Loading of the LCTs, and at
Zierikzee also Landing Craft Mechanized ships (LCM5, a smaller version
of the
LCT), transportation at
sea and dumping was performed under authority of the
Dutch
Navy. The archives present evidence that munition from the coastal defence
as part of the German Atlantikwali
was also dumped in the same manner. Figure 1
shows
that the LCTs did not carry loading cranes and that loading
of munition was
consequently performed hand. For
by loading and dumping, use was made of a
conveyer
belt as shown in Figure 1. [Ruis, 2011] reported that dumping
of lighter
munitions started when leaving the river mouth
of the Nieuwe Waterweg and that
floating munition
was fired upon using the LCT’s machine gun until the munition
exploded or sank.

According to [Woensel, 2004] an estimated total of 60,000
tons munition was
dumped; roughly 47,000 were
tons dumped on two locations in the North Sea, 30 to
40 kilometres away from the coastline 0ff Hook of Holland and
IJmuiden and
roughly 13,000 tons were dumped
in the Oosterschelde. TNO will assume a
conservative amount of 30,000 and 20,000 tons dumped
of munition at IJmuiden
and Hook of Holland respectively.
2.3 Types
of dumped munition
The records directly related to the dumping activities focus general
on the
procedures and amount of
the total munition. These records provide limited
information on the specific types of munitions that were dumped. records
The
describing munition activities
clearing reveal that land mines were blown in place
and that sea mines were defused and transported to the Explosives
Factory in
Muiden where the explosive
content was extracted for reuse.
The aircraft bombs that were dropped by German of Allied
aircraft on Dutch soil
without exploding were too
dangerous to be handled as these bombs could
potentially be activated when disturbed. These types of UnExploded
Ordnance
(UXO) were typically
blown in place or nearby the site of detection. Furthermore, it
seems unlikely that large quantities of heavy aircraft
bombs were left behind at the
military airfields as these were primarily
used for fighter aircraft. It is thus unlikely
that aircraft bombs were dumped at sea in large numbers.
From the available records it appears that the greater part
of the dumped munition
came from dump sites
on land or field storages from the Allied and German land
and naval forces such as shown in Figure 3. This munition is
in the safe position
and therefore safe to
be transported. These sites and storages are thought to
typically contain munitions such as:
• Hand grenades;
• Demolition charges;
• Small calibre, machine
e.g. 0.5” gun rounds;
• Medium calibre, e.g. 20 —40 mm anti-aircraft rounds;
• Large calibre, e.g. mortars,
81 mm 105 mm, 155 mm and 8” field artillery shells.

As munition was supposed to sink within three munition
seconds, the weight of
boxes was increased and
packaging was perforated. Special care was taken with
munition containing phosphor. Due to a phosphor munition incident on 28
related
July 1946 these types of
munition were to be blown at or near the site of detection.
As a result, dumping of phosphorous munition has likely
stopped or significantly
decreased after August
1946.
Furthermore, Unexploded
Ordnance (UXO) and munition with the fuze still present
were not allowed to be transported unless special precautionary measures were
taken. The Van Waning
collection for example reveals that base-fused quick firing
separate shells not in crates, were to be reported before being
to the Directorate
offered for dumping, which suggests
that fuzed munitions have been dumped. An
underwater camera image of an article considered to be a quick firing separate, is
given in Figure 4.

contact 1.49).
According to a former commander and amateur historian of the EOD, aircraft
bombs have been dumped in the North
Sea [Rozenbeek]. The dumping of aircraft
bombs is corroborated by Figure 5 [image 0738D obtained Foundation
from the
Historical Archive EOD], with
caption “dumping of a 3000 kg bomb from an LCT in
deep sea water”. The addition of “deep sea water” however, typically refers to water
depths of hundreds or a few
thousand meters, which suggests that this bomb has
not been dumped at the dumping areas off Ijmuiden and Hook of Holland.

Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) place shells on gravity rollers that take the ammunition
over the side of the ship and into the sea [Imperial War Museum].
The
available records regarding the dump in the North Sea show that munition was
dumped in its packaging present. whether
if It is not known single or multiple boxes
where
thrown overboard (in nets or on pallets). Munition transport units in that
period were sized for manual with
loading and unloading, so a maximum gross
mass of approximately 30 to 60 kg per box. In modern munition, the largest
amounts of high explosive per box
are found in 120 mm mortar shelis, which are
packaged
with 2 rounds per box, with a gross mass of approximately 50 kg and a
High Explosive (HE) mass of 7.8 kg.
Boxes with demolition charges may contain a
larger amount
of HE per box but since confinement of the explosive is a conditiori
for a detonation impact,
under the risk posed by such charges is thought to be less
than posed by steel cased munition (as discussed in section 5.3.2). The largest
artillery shelis were accordingly considered
to pose the greatest single munition
item threat as they contain the highest amourit of explosive (e.g. the 24 cm shell
from coastal batteries
has a filling of approximately 12 kg TNT).
The largest munition types were
retrieved from the German coastal Atlantikwail
defence at Rozenburg with 28 cm guns (transferred from the German battieship
Gneisenau) when these fortifications
were demilitarized by the Royal Dutch Navy.
These
guns fired very heavy shells of approximately 300 kg that consisted for
a
large part of steel to penetrate heavy
armours and only a relatively small amount of
explosive
(15 - 18 kg). Although it is at least questionable whether such heavy
shelis could be overboard,
thrown they may have been simply rolled off the ship as
shown in Figure 5. This munition type accordingly presents the largest single
item
threat. However, number
the of dumped naval artillery sheils is anticipated to be
small compared to the number of dumped field artillery shells. From this perspective
the 8” artillery shell (203
mm calibre) with a weight of about 110 kg and containing
approximately
12 kg TNT [Kroon, E., et al., 2009] is considered as the largest single
item threat under the assumption performed
that dumping was by hand.
Dumping was also performed with Viking,
three coasters called Paloma and
Halstadt
or Haimstad (see the ship inventory described in the Letter to Dutch Naval
Commander, date 3 December 1945 is
in Appendix B). It anticipated that these
coasters

This implies that the munition articles will only become uncovered

transport conditions radically,
change when a fast sand transport would take place,
faster than the articles can be covered by the tidal action.
The sonar plots in Figure 11 and Figure 12 demonstrate
that only a tiny fraction of
the munition is uncovered. likely
It is that the sonar contacts represent munition
items
that are lying in the troughs where the sediment cover is thinnest.
The sonar
contacts appear to lie straight
in mes oriented perpendicular to the tidal current,
which seems to corroborate this hypothesis.

4 Description of incident scenarios
The following incident scenarios potentially occurring at the dump sites are
considered for the risk analysis [Berlo, 2011]:
• ship sinks;
• ship anchors;
• drifter drags anchor;
• fishing baat drags anchor / bottom trawling gear;
• ship loses container deck cargo
or other
• vibration of ship movement disturbs seabed;
• water turbulence due to propeller wash disturbs seabed;
• ship strikes seabed with keel or propeller.
A wide variety of vessel types are to be included for the analysis, ranging from small
fishing vessels to oil tankers, small to largest category container ships, ships
transporting containers, chemicals and LPG [Berlo, 2011]. These ships are
categorized in ships carrying cargo and explosive cargo and normal (i.e.
polluting
non polluting and non explosive) cargo when relevant for the incident scenario.
Apart from a sinking ship and a ship striking the seabed with its keel or propeller,
between the keel of the vessel and the
these scenarios relate to the distance
munition article. This distance depends on the water depth, height of the sand
waves and draught of the vessel. These subjects are described in the next sections.
and draught
4.1 Water depth, height of sand waves
The water depth at the munition dump site IJmuiden is 21 m or more and is
low water level (LLWL) to the crest of the
measured by the distance from the lowest
sand waves on the seabed. The munition will lie deeper, in the troughs of the 2 m
high sand waves, at a depth of at least 23m (confirmed by Ministry of Infrastructure
and the Environment) [Berlo, 9 November 2011]. Atthe dump site Hook of Holland
waves are about 6 m high. The
the water depth is 19 m or more and the sand
munition accordingly lies at approximately 25m depth or deeper [Angeren,
paragraph 2, 2011]. Accordingly, the munition at Ijmuiden is situated less deep
than for Hook of Holland.
The tides at the dump sites have an amplitude of 0.5 to 1 m (difference between
lowest 10w water level to Mean Sea Level (MSL)). The average tide will be
approximately 0.5 m, so the average depth is increased by 0.5 m. In storms, the
waves approximately 4 m, but vessels with the
largest can have an amplitude of

5 Exposure,
likelihood of interaction with munition and
likelihood
of munition reaction
The exposure
(or probability of occurrence of a specific scenario) discussed
is in
the first paragraph. The likelihood of interaction
with munition is assessed in the
second paragraph and is based on the actual situation at the
dump sites. The
likelihood of munition reaction (burn,
deflagration or detonation) is discussed in the
third paragraph.
The third paragraph will assess the likelihood of sympathetic
detonation in order to know
whether or not one can rule out the possibility of a
propagation
of reaction throughout (part of) the munition dump, and
will treat the
effect of mechanical deformation on
the initiation of a munition. The likelihooci of
ignition
and consequential munition reaction is discussed both for direct
a
mechanical contact, for example
due to a sinking ship or a dropped anchor, and an
indirect mechanical
contact through the propagation of vibration to sensitive
waves
components like fuzes.
5.1 Exposure
The exposure is based
on probability calculations at the dumping areas as
presented two
in documents by MARIN [MARIN, 2011 a,b]. In the document,
latter
an addendum to the quantitative
risk assessment, the probabilities are given for the
following
scenarios:
• The present route structure;
• The
proposed route structure in which the northbound lane Traffic
of the
Separation Scheme (TSS)
is moved eastwards, so that the dumping areas will
be located
in the separation zone;
• The alternative route
structure, thus with the dumping areas near Rotterdam
located in
the northbound lane of the TSS.
Table 2 and Table 3 present the probabilities various scenarios
of at the location of
dumping grounds with
respect to the present route structure, and for route-bound
ships fishing
and vessels with Automated Identification System (Als), respectively.

Probability of incident per year
The
following notes relate to the specified incident scenarios.
Ship sinks
The exposure is derived from the probability of foundering and the probability of
sinking after collision.
The exposure inciudes the sinking of fishing vessels.
Ship anchors
The exposure equals the probability to anchor where the ship saus in the present
route structure.
The exposure is derived from the probabulities to anchoring in the
lane, in the separation zone and just outside the shipping lane of the TSS for both
the alternative and
the proposed route structure. The exposure inciudes the
anchoring of fishing vessels.

A summary of the exposure at the munition dump sites Table 6, with
is given in
figures derived from [MARIN, 2011a,b].
The probability of a ship sinking on a
munition dump site is increased by a factor of six for the alternative route structure,
while it decreases to (almost) zero
with the proposed route structure in place to
regulate ship traffic.
The probability of ships anchoring
or dragging an anchor is doubled with respect to
the current situation. The probability for ships loosing cargo at the dump sites is
increased more than tenfold
for the alternative route structure, whereas for the
proposed route structure this probability is actually lower than in present
the
situation.
The probabilities are differentiated
by colours on a relative scale going from
impossible (blue) at the left to frequent (red) at the right. Colour coding is assigned
per decade in probability per
year and a translation is made to qualitative terms in
line with the Fine & Kinney method. Where numbers are absent, colours are
assigned in accordance with
comparable scenarios.

Assuming that these

each covering a surface of 500 m2, the areal density of munition dump sites
at the

or /m2m2 (Hook of Holland).
In the direct mechanical
contact scenarios a quantitative assessment of the
likelihood of the interaction with munition is made.
Ship sinks
A ship with typical Iength
and width of 150 X 30 m has a large surface area
compared to the 500 m2 area of a single munition pile. The probability of interaction
is well approximated values

number of munition piles divided by the total area of The probability

of the ship to interact with a munition
pile is 0.07 to 0.15. The likelihood of
interaction is considered likely.
Ship
strikes seabed with keel orpropeller
The surface area
of the ship is assumed to be representative for this incident
scenario, and the probability of interaction with munition is equal to the probability
in
the sinking ship scenario.
The likelihood when a ship strikes the seabed with keel or
propeller is considered likely.

possible.
Ship
loses container
A container is
expected to interfere only with the top layer of the seabed. The areal
density of munitions at the seabed is smaller than the areal density of the munition
piles. An indication of the
smaller areal density of munitions at the dump site is dear
from sonar surveys [Ham et al., 2001], [Van Angeren, 2011]. Van Angeren
12.9.106
performed a sonar survey
atthe Hook of Holland dump site. In the 2m
survey 55 sonar contacts were made with an average size of all contacts of
sonar
20 The areal density
m2. of sonar contacts is 910 /mm As the container surface
(20*
area 8 ft2 = 14.4 m2) is smaller than the average size, the
sonar contact
of the container
probability to interactwith munitions equals g•i-. The likelihood of
a lost container to interact with munition is considered conceivable very unlikely.
but
Ship
loses deck cargo
For lost deck
cargo that only interferes with the top layer of the seabed, and with a
similar surface area as a container, the probability to interact munitions is also
with
910-. The likelihood of
a lost deck cargo to interact with munition is considered
conceivable but very unlikely.
boat
Fishing drags bottom trawling gear
The penetration depth
of beam trawl depends on weight, towing speed and type of
substrate and will be 1 to 8 cm [Paschen et al., 2000]. For trawling munition needs
a
to be exposed at the surface
of the seabed for any interference to occur. The typical
area for a fishing boat crossing the munition dump is far larger munition
than

When a munition

the

latter is for the

through a limited number of contact points

In the that

An ignition of the explosive may
occur depending on its sensitivity to
mechanical stimuli.
Note that this mechanical sensitivity differs from
the shock

burning reaction

and amount of explosive, and the
strength of its confinement. This phenomenon
is
called a DDT

loading of a munition
The deformation and
pressure thresholds in Table 12 for inducing reactions
in thick
thin
and case munition have been applied impact
to the of large concrete debris on
munitions through 3-dimensional
numerical simulations [Malvar, 1996].
Two
examples of the simulation of an M107 155
mm’shell impacted by a 12 inch
diameter piece of concrete
are given in Figure 24. At the left side of the figure
is a
impact
the on a free standing 155 mm shell,
at the right side the impact on the
same shell stand ing against
a solid back wall. In the latter case the
deformation of
the high explosive fill is more severe. This situation
compares for example to the
impact of a ship’s keel on
a pile of crossed cylinders (munitions). Instead
of the
impact
of the concrete sphere the impact realized
is by the solid wall; but the
transfer of impulse
to the impacted shell, thus its deformation, will
be of the same
order.
The summary of the
numerical simulations in terms of deformation and
pressure are
copied
in Table 16. A prediction of the reaction violence
is given, based on the
thresholds in Table 12.
At impact velocities below 800 ftls the presence
of a back
wall makes a significant contribution to the
crushing of the munition. A rough order
estimate of the impact impulse
required for sufficient deformation to cause
a low
order reaction
is kgm/s.
By comparison
of the 10 kgm/s threshold impulse in non-uniform
mechanical
loading with the 3.110 Pas threshold impulse
in uniform mechanical loading, see
Table 14, one can roughly
state that these loadings are comparable in
case of 31
load-bearing
points per square meter. For
large caliber munitions one may expect
that a uniformly applied
laad will be borne in less than 31 contact
points per square
meter
for a munition pile, which is a direct indication
that non-uniform mechanical
loading is worse compared
to uniform mechanical loading.

In [Wallace,
1994] it is conciuded that ignitions and
explosions are observed for
munitions that previously
had undergone and successfully passed conventional
drop tests
(ie. at flat surfaces), and that in some cases
modest drop heights
produce a very violent response.
Empirical relationships for the likelihood of
initiation
are developed according to [Wallace,
1994]. One example for the
likelihood of initiation of a
Mkl 1 depth charge is shown in Figure 26, showing drop
height and
drop weight combinations. No further data on spigot
intrusion tests with
all-up-round munitions are found
in open literature.
An important finding is that those spigots that punch
out a piece of the casing of the
munition are found to be the cause
of ignition. Another important finding is that no
empirical
relationships are established for the violence
of the response.

Spigot intrusion
into cylindrical samples of high explosive has been performed
using
a 2500 kg drop weight and a 13 or 35 mm diameter
spigot [Cartwright et al., 2007].
The target assembly
with spigot and confined explosive, and drop weight
the
arrangement are shown in Figure 27 and Figure
28 respectively. Steel mass
catchers are in
place to limit the pinch to 1 mm and to prevent the target assembly
to be crushed. The test results, which include
Composition B and TNT, are copied
from [Cartwright
et al., 2007] in Table 17. In these experiments Composition
B is
shown to be more sensitive to this
intrusive impact scenario than TNT. Also a
deflagration/detonation
type of response is noted for Composition B in
case the
impact weight of 2500 kg weight drives
a 35 mm spigot into the sample at a drop
weight velocity low
as as 4.43 m/s.

werkzaamheden
Wij achten de volgende werkzaamheden noodzakelijk voor het ruimen
van de
munitie:
• Lokaliseren en inmeten van de stortpiaatsen
(bijvoorbeeld door middel van
magnetometers en metaal
detectoren);
• Baggeren van de en sliblaag
zand- waarin de munitie ligt. Klein en midden
kaliber munitie worden
opgebaggerd, groot kaliber blijft op de bodem achter
wordt
en vervolgens stuksgewljs boven water gehaald. Hiervoor zal een
gespecialiseerde methode nodig zijn; te
denken valt aan onderwatercamera
beelden voor precieze locatie
van artikelen en een bepantserde hijsinstallatie
met een (magnetische) grjper;
• De vrijgekomen bagger
(geschat op miljoenen kubieke meters) wordt gezeefd
met behulp van een
gepantserde zeefinstallatie. Klein kaliber munitie wordt
er
verbrand; zijn geen grote explosies te verwachten en het kan verbrand
dus
worden in een afvaiverbrandingsoven. De explosieve inhoud
van midden en
groot kaliber munitie wordt eerst verwijderd
(leeggespoten). Deze
ongevaarlijke slurrie
wordt verbrand in een draaitrommel oven voor chemisch
afval. De
metalen onderdelen worden als schroot afgevoerd.
Tijdsduur
De tijdsduur van het ruimen van
een munitiedump gebied is moeilijk in te schatten.
Er is ervaring van de ruiming van munitie
Duitse In de Mokbaai waarmee we een
schatting hebben
gemaakt. Uit de Mokbaai zijn iii een jaar vijf duizend munitie-
artikelen geruimd met een pieksnelheid
van tientallen granaten per dag
[Nieuwsarchlef
gemeente TaxeIj. Hieruit leiden we af dat ruiming enkele
van
miljoenen stuks munitie uit de
Noordzee honderd jaar in beslag neemt Met een
alternatieve simplistische benadering, waarbij wordt uitgegaan
dat het ruimen tien
keer langer duurt dan het storten (in
ruim twee Jaar), wordt de tijdsduur geschat op
twintig jaar, Samenvattend Is onze verwachting dat enkele tientallen
het ruimen
jaren zal duren.

Op advies van dhr. P. de

Deze met de hand geschreven journaals
beschrijven de dagelijkse gang van
zaken aan boord van een schip.
In tegenstelling tot de aanvankelijke
opzet om de munitie zo veel mogelijk te
verspreiden door al varend de munitie overboord te zetten blijkt uit de
scheepsjournaals dat
deze procedure niet uitvoerbaar was vanwege de
weersomstandigheden; de LCTs blijken niet geschikt
voor de ruwe zeegang.
Relevante details uit deze journaals zijn de volgende:
De totale lading van een Landing Craft Tank
(LCT) is ongeveer 220 ton, geladen
ongeveer 5,5
in dag door 40 Duitse krijgsgevangenen. Gemiddeld
wordt er eens
per maand gedumpt. Locatie
van de dumping is meestal de dumpsite IJmuiden;
een enkele keer wordt er van Hoek van Holland uitgevaren
naar de dump aldaar
voor de kust.
Het dumpen vindt plaats tot in het najaar van 1946, daarna nog
is er door 1 schip
gedumpt tot in
het voorjaar van 1947 (LCT 7121>. Het archief vertoont hier helaas
een grote lacune: de journaals beginnen
allemaal op 1juni1946 Dit komt door
het feit de
dat in periode daarvoor het dumpen wordt uitgevoerd onder British
Commando zoals blijkt uit onderzoek
in het archief van het Nederlands Instituut
voor
Militaire Historie (NIMH). De journaals van de die deelnamen aan

1 SUMMARY IN DUTCH
1.1 Introductie
De ambitie van de Nederlandse overheid is om een totaal vermogen van 6000 MW aan
windenergie te realiseren Noordzee. 2010 kwantitatieve
op de In is een risicoanalyse
(QRA = Quantitative Risk Assessment) uitgevoerd voor 6 varianten met binnen elke
variant een aantal subvarianten. De resultaten hiervan zijn gerapporteerd in [1].
Sindsdien zijn de discussies
doorgegaan met alle stakeholders. Deze hebben geleid tot
het voorstel van een nieuwe routestructuur, waarbij ruim baan wordt gegeven aan de
vergunde windparken in ronde 2 (dit zijn de windparken Beaufort, Breeveertien, Brown
Ridge East, Den Helder, Q10, Q4, Tromp en West-Rijn). Alleen windpark Scheveningen
Buiten kan dan niet worden gerealiseerd windpark verplaatste
omdat het midden in het
VSS Maas Noord zou komen te liggen. Het VSS Maas Noord is naar het westen
verplaatst om dicht bij de kust ruimte te creëren voor andere activiteiten.
Het doel van de nieuwe routestructuur is de verbetering van de veiligheid rondom
offshore platforms in het algemeen en het Horizon platform in het bijzonder, een
veiligere aanloop van IJmuiden, veiligere en grotere ankergebieden en tenslotte veilige
locaties voor
het ontwikkelen van windenergie.
Dit rapport bevat de QRA voor deze nieuwe routestructuur, ciie verder aangeduid wordt
met “voorgestelde
routestructuur” en ook een QRA voor windpark Q10, omdat verwacht
wordt dat dit windpark op korte termijn gebouwd gaat worden, zodat de
verkeersafwikkeling met de windparken OWEZ, Prinses Amalia en Q10 het beste als de
“huidige” verkeersafwikkeling kan worden
beschouwd.
De berekeningen zijn uitgevoerd voor de lay-out van de nieuwe routestructuur van 16
september 2011. Op dit ontwerp zijn bij het DW ankergebied bij IJmuiden wijzigingen
aangebracht
die niet in de tekeningen van dit rapport verwerkt zijn.
1.2 Kader van de SAMSON berekeningen
Het
doel van deze studie is het uitvoeren van een kwantitatieve risicobeoordeling
(QRA), waarin de effecten op de veiligheid voor de scheepvaart door de voorgestelde
routestructuur worden gekwantificeerd. Daarvoor worden voor deze routestructuur de
risico’s voor de scheepvaart gekwantificeerd, vaarafstanden
alsook de effecten op en de
daarmee verband
houdende extra kosten en uitstoot van milieubelastende stoffen.
Een QRA is een onderdeel van een Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) studie die zal
worden uitgevoerd met de resultaten van deze studie. Een FSA is een proces dat nodig
is om goedkeuring van de IMO te verkrijgen, als activiteit veranderingen
een leidt tot in
de internationale (lMO) scheepvaartroutes.
1.3 Werkwijze
Dezelfde werkwijze wordt gevolgd als in [1]. Dat wil zeggen dat er een
verkeersdatabase wordt aangemaakt iedere
voor verkeersafwikkeling die beschouwd
wordt. De belangrijkste verkeersafwikkeling is die voor de voorgestelde routestructuur.
Om een beter gevoel voor de resultaten te verkrijgen is er voor gezorgd dat de
resultaten zo goed mogelijk te vergelijken zijn met die van [1]. Daarom is uitgegaan van

ook groter is, is de ETV bij windkracht vanaf 5 gestationeerd,

platforms wordt de kans veel kleiner, zoals voor Horizon, maar
voor andere platforms neemt de kans juist flink toe. Dit heeft alles te
maken met de locatie van de platforms ten opzichte van de verschoven
routes. De kans op een aanvaring/aandrijving met het platform Horizon
door een
routegebonden schip neemt met 25% af, maar Horizon blijft het
platform met het grootste risico.

2 INTRODUCTION
The ambition of the Dutch
government is to realize offshore
wind farms with a total
installed
power of 6000 MW. The question “where
in the North Sea” is subject of many
discussions because of the opposite interests
of different stakeholders. Several studies
on different topics
already have been performed,
Last year, a Quantitative Risk Assessment
(QRA) has been performed for six variants,
each containing a number of
sub-variarits. The report “Quantitative Risk Assessment
for
Offshore Wind Farms the
in North Sea” of May 2010, reference contains
[1], the results
of all variants and
sub-variants at that time.
Since then, ongoing discussions
with all stakeholders have resulted in a proposal
for a
new route structure
on the Dutch part of the North Sea that is
based on concentrating
the
shipping in a network of routes. This network
of routes is developed in such a way
that all wind farms that were licensed in
round 2 (wind farms Beaufort, Breeveertien,
Browri Ridge East,
Den Helder, Q10, Q4, Tromp and West-Rijn)
can be built, with the
exception of
Scheveningen Buiten, because this
wind farm will come into the Maas

activities.

The topic of this report is
the impact of the proposed route structure on
safety of
shipping. Also
aspects such as costs of extra miles and emissions by
detours, are

5 IN PUT FOR THE CALCULATIONS
5.1 The traffic databases
The most important element for a risk assessment is the traffic database. The traffic
database describes where shipping sails and with which intensity. The traffic database is
composed by determining the routes over sea for all ships A port 8 and
from port to
summarizing
all ship movements on the routes. The shortest route will be followed,
taking into account the regulations, traffic separation schemes, the water depths and the
obstructions at sea such as offshore platforms and wind farms. Each traffic database is
constructed from the same set of movements from A to 8, but each with a different set
of routeing schemes and obstructions.
For this study two new traffic databases have been developed, namely:
• one for the existing route structure and existing obstructions, inciuding the wind

changed in the different steps and which benefits it has
Finally the four traffic databases used in the QRA are presented in Figure 5-1 to Figure
5-4. All are based on the same set of shipping movements of 2008.
Figure 5-1 shows the “base”, being the traffic flows for the traffic separation schemes in
2011 with the existing wind farms OWEZ and Princess Amalia (taken from [1]).
Figure 5-2 shows the traffic flow of variant 1, taken from [1], for which the traffic is routed
around the wind farms that are licensed in round 2. Only in the far west area a larger
area is cleared of shipping than necessary for the wind farms Tromp, Den Helder and
Brown Ridge East. This case is used to illustrate the effect of the proposed route
structure on the collision risk of these round 2 wind farms. This case is referred to as
“Routeing present situation with 11 wind farms in place”.
Figure 5-3 shows the traffic database for the case that wind farm 010 is added to the
base case. This case is referred to as ‘Routeing present situation with 3 wind farms in

route structure consists of a network of routes, of which the borders are plotted with
black lines in Figure 5-4. The objective is that ships will follow these routes, which
means that they will pass wind farm areas licensed in the round 2 on a distance of at
least two nautical miles. This will reduce the collision risk with a wind turbine. On the
other hand this way of routeing will result in a higher concentration of shipping which
may result in a higher probability of collision. Only the route from IJmuiden to the deep
water routes (chemical eastern coast of UK and
and oil tankers) and to the north the
vice versa will cross the black-defined areas. This case is referred to as ‘Routeing

Because the proposed route structure is developed the wind
while taking into account
farms licensed in round
2, it is important to see the impact of the proposed route
structure on these licensed wind farms when they are built. The best way to do that is to
determine the collision risk for these wind farms without changes in the route structure
and the collision risk of the same wind
farms for the proposed route structure and
compare these values.
Variant 1 of [1] is taken as the traffic database changes
with minimum in traffic flows
when the wind
licensed farms are built. Figure 5-2 shows that for this variant, extra
space is cleared of shipping around the wind farms Tromp, Den Helder and Brown
Ridge East. This means that the risk reducing effect of the proposed route structure on
collisions with wind turbines
is already realized in variant 1 for these wind farms. Even
the proposed

All wind turbines are defined as separate objects. The probability ramming and drifting

is determined for each wind turbine.
It is assumed that a drifting ship continues drifting
after a wind turbine is hit. Thus one drifting ship can hit more than one wind turbine. The
ship stops drifting when:
• anchoring is successful (no contact at all);
• the failure is repaired, using the distribution function for repairing;
• 24 hours are passed (the maximum drifting time);
• an emergency towing vessel (ETV) has arrived with sufficient capacity for the
prevailing weather conditions to recover the ship;
The probabilities of drifting,
failure to anchor and the drifting time are derived from the
drifters database that MARIN has been receiving from the Netherlands Coastguard
monthly since 2002. Because the drifters database of the Netherlands Coastguard only
contains the data of the ships have the database
that reported failure, this is not
complete. Therefore, several analyses of AlS data have been performed to achieve a
complete picture of all drifters.

In the no ETV is included, which means that the probability of
drifting contacts can be decreased by including one or more ETVs.
For each wind farm a generic configuration of 5 wind turbines is composed

according method described
the in Chapter 5.2. The real configuration will be different
but will have only minor effects on the collision risk per wind turbine. Figure 6-2 contains

Princess Amalia, and the wind farms inciuded in the

6.3 Total risk
due to the wind farms
Chapter 6.1 contains the extra costs
of accidents and detours outside the wind farms
due to the
changes in the traffic flows. Chapter 6.2 contains the probabilities of contacts
with the
wind turbines but not the costs involved with these contacts. In this chapter all
costs, thus risk and additional sailing costs are quantified. For this
purpose some
assumptions have been with respect
made to the damage of the wind turbines. These
assumptions are
extracted from the studies carried out for individual wind farms. The
most
important assumption is the probability that the wind turbine is lost by
the contact.
The following percentages are used:
• 100% after a ramming contact by a route-bound
ship;
• 20% after a ramming contact by a non-route-bound
ship;
• 85% after a drifting contact by a route-bound
ship;
• 10% after a drifting contact by a non-route-bound
ship;
An amount of M€ 10 is taken for a wind turbine
that is lost.
An amount
of M€ 104 is used for the average damage costs for the ship
that has a
contact with a wind turbine It is expected to the ship
that the damage will be lower in
general.
Table

the
probabilities that a wind turbine is lost, thus the Table

percentages The center part of the table contains the yearly
costs of
accidents with the wind farm and of accidents and extra miles outside the wind

7 MOVEMENTS TO

number of ships will be spread over the four anchorage
areas in such a way that the
average number of ships per
square miie (the traffic density) is the same for all
anchorage
areas. However, no attention was paid to the routes to and from these
anchorage
areas while these change considerably. By incorporating
not this in Chapter
6, comparison of the resuits with the results for
traffic variants of [1] was made possible.
In thid chapter
the impact of the change in the movements to and from the anchorage
areas is quantified. For the present anchorage the
area movements to and from the
anchor areas are presented in Figure

Table 8-1 contains the probabilities of contact with a wreck under the
a that is directly
water surface, which means that all ships will hit the wreck. However, small ships with
limited drafts will not hit the wreck when crossing the wreck, because sufficient water is
available above the wreck. The probability of an actual contact depends on the least
sounded depth, the draft of the vessel and the tide. Generally it can be that
assumed
ships with a draft larger than
a certain value will hit the wreck in case of crossing.
Therefore Table 8-1 contains the cumulative probabilities. For example: the probability
0006222 for the proposed route structure in the column 5000 to 10000 GT means that
the probability of hitting the
wreck of a ship of 5000GT or larger is 0006622, assuming
that ships of this size class have enough draft to hit the wreck.
For each ship size class, the average (is maximum
design draft draft) is determined and
put in Table 8-1.
The operational draft is always smaller than the design draft, which
means that using the design draft will result in an overestimation of the contact
probability. Figure 8-5 is composed based on the design drafts and the probabilities of
Table 8-1 and contains the probability of contact as
a a function of the water depth
above the wreck. The figure should be read as follows. A water depth of, for example,
10,8m above the wreck (the depth indicated in the nautical charts before the salvage
attempt) results in a contact probability of 0,0064 per for the present traffic
year flows,
thus on average
one accident every 1/0,0064 = 156 years. For the proposed route
structure the probability of hitting is 0,0052 a year, thus once every 192 years.

Only the last column of the table makes sense because the other
ships will sail just over
the wreck without hitting the wreck. Therefore, the
other values are crossed out. Also,
most ships
in the largest class will not have sufficient draft to hit the wreck.
When it is assumed that all ships above the wreck of
more than 100000GT will hit the
wreck, the probability of a contact

the probability of a contact.
This is not
according to expectation, because more routes with high iritensity are located
closer
to the wreck. Reasons for this unexpected reduction are:
• 70% of the probability of a contact in the present situation is caused by

flows for the proposed route
structure because ships have
these to follow the proposed route structure.
• The dense traffic flows proposed
for the route structure are traffic lanes within a
certain form of
TSS, while the present traffic flows are sailing without a strict
lateral limitation. This means that the lateral distribution of present traffic
the
flows is wider than for the traffic flows the proposed

Therefore more ships
will pass the wreck on short distance even when the
centreline
of the traffic flow is further away.
Because the water depth above the wreck is nearly
always larger than is indicated in the
nautical chart with 21 .3m
to LAT, It is extremely unlikely that a ship will hit the wreck. An
analysis of the
AlS data of 2010 has been performed to get insight in the size

The dumping area of IJmuiden has been crossed

voyages. 57 voyages were made by a fishing ship. In 25 cases the was smaller

engaged in fishing. Given the fishirig activity and the number of different fishing
vessels that were active in the dumping areas,
it can be concluded that the dumping
area is not avoided by
fishing vessels.

The following incidents can happen in a dumping
area:
• ship sinks,
• ship has a contact with the sea bottom;
• ship anchors;
• fishing vessels that have cpntact with the sea bottom by fishing gear;
• Loss of cargo such as container or other deck cargo.
The probabilities of above
incidents will be quantified for the three dumping areas, for
the proposed route structure. This means that the route-bound traffic will disappear from
the dumping area near IJmuiden, because this dumping area will located in an area
be
that is cleared of shipping. Furthermôre, it
is expected that non-route-bound activities
such fishing will decrease
as in the dumping areas near Rotterdam because these areas
will be located in a busy traffic lane of the moved Maas-North TSS.
Probability of sinking
A ship can sink as
a single incident after being overwhelmed by the sea, which is called
foundering, sink
a or due to a collision with another ship. The first incident has a larger
probability than the second, because the probability that a ship will sink after a collision
in a one-way traffic lane is very
unlikely. Therefore, only the incident of foundering is
considered ii the estimation
of the probability that a ship will sink in the dumping area.
Probability of a container or other deck cargo overboard
The probability of loss of a container or deck cargo
is used in several studies of MARIN
with respect to the risk for a cable or

updated based on new data. Some sources estimate that 10000 containers are lost per

Explanation
for a better understanding of the probability of a collision
The probability of a collision is determined from the calculated number of encounters
between ships. The encounter is classified
based on the course difference between the
ships.
A distinction is made between an overtaking (course difference is less than 60°),
600
crossing (course difference between and 150°) and a head on (course difference
between 150 and 180 encounter. The probability of a collision given encounter, is
an
°)
clearly different
for the three situations. The probability of a collision, given a crossing
encounter is larger than in case of en overtaking encounter. Sometimes this discrete
classification of encounters is too rough for a sound result in a small area.
The probability a collision is based
on singular meetings. When a third ship is involved at
the same
time the probability of a collision will increase, because the number of
encounters increases. For the triple ship encounter, in total six encounters between two
ships are counted, thus three times as much means that
as in a singular encounter. This
the probability
of a collision for a triple encounter is equal to the probability of a collision
in three encounters between ships, thus as if the ships would have met each other in
separate encounters.
The probability of a collision given an ericounter is not geographically
related and
therefore does not depend
on the distance to en object such as a platform, or a wind
turbine. Too few collisions have occurred under these circumstances to be able to
include this in the modeling.
The probability of a collision given en encounter
depends on the type of ship, the ship’s
size and the weather conditions. The calculation of the number of encounters is based
on the distribution of the speed of ships at sea. In some areas, when boarding or
disembarking the pilot, some ships will sail at lower The difference in speed can
speeds.
result
in more encounters. The resuits of the calculations can be improved when these
areas are modeled in more detail. The number of meetings can then be determined
more precisely. A new issue will be how the collision probability changes with the speed
of the ships concerned.
But in any case the differences between variants can be
quantified more precisely.

Because of the locatiori of the different ports and the traffic separation schemes in the
area, most of the route-bound ships sail on a network comparable with the
large of links,
with the
road network. Every ship is allowed to sail ‘anywhere” as long as one complies
rules and regulations. Thus ships could also sail outside the defined network. However,
the number of ships sailing outside the network is very small, because the network
contains the shortest route between ports.
A new traffic database is generated for the location of the wind farm. The location of the
wind farm sail through

a wind turbine.

The non-route-bound traffic cannot be modelled the same way as the
traffic, because the information about the journeys is not inctuded in the Lloyds
database. Moreover, the behaviour of these non-route-bound ships at sea is very

departure A. The behaviour of these ships at sea is mostly unpredictable. Fishing

also usually sail from one fishing ground to another during one
Therefore, the traffic image of the non-route-bound traffic is modelled by densities of
ships in a so-called grid celI of 8 x 8 km. The size of this celI is historically connected to
the grid ceIl size used in the North Sea. Other sizes of the grid celis can be applied but it
has only a finer grid. The local policy for making
sense when the densities are known on

The drift model contains a table with the probability of failure to
classes. The failure probability increases strongly with the wind force. Further, the self
repairing time function is modelled to determine the maximum time of the drifting
process without
assistance from outside.
The effect of one or more ETVs (Emergency Towing Vessels), thus vessels that can get
control over the drifting ships by taking her in tow, can be determined by the input of one
or more ETVs. For each ETV the geographical position and a number of characteristics,
such
as speed and towing capacity are required.
No ETVs are modelled in this study.

4.5. Visuele inspectie ROHP
De data van
ROHP inspectie is verwerkt in deze rapportage,
en staat bij de sonar contacten in bijlage 2.
Op basis
van de Multibeam en side scan sonar resultaten
wordt een advies gegeven betreffende de
aangetroffen contacten en eventuele andere
bijzonderheden aan de opdrachtgever.
Advies
Uit de sonardata blijkt dat er gebied
in dit veel bodemverstoringen zijn waargenomen
en ook veel zeer
veel kleine
contacten alleen de clusters staan in deze rapportage),
( dit komt door het karakter van het
gebied nl. veel zandribbels die een
hoge mate van reflectie geven, waardoor schelpen banken
en
andere natuurlijke
bodemverschijnselen op het sonargram zichtbaar zijn.
onderscheid
Het tussen deze natuurlijke bodemverschijnselen
en eventuele munitie is door de sonar niet
te maken, en alleen door visuele
inspectie vast te stellen. Dit gaat echter door vele aantal
het reflecties
veel tijd kosten.
Inzet van een magnetometer zal misschien
een mogelijkheid zijn om tijd te winnen.
De gegevenslevering bestaat
uit dit rapport met een overzicht van de Multibeam data (Figuur
5) en een
side scan
sonar contactenlijst. Als bijlagen zijn de afbeeldingen
van de aangetroffen contacten, indien
beschikbaar met historische informatie (Bijlage
3). Indien een contact twee maal voorkomt,
wordt in de
afbeeldingenrapportage
de beste afbeelding gepresenteerd. Deze afbeelding
wordt ook opgenomen in
de 5R9 contactendatabase.
Bovenstaande informatie wordt
ook digitaal aangeleverd. Hierbij wordt van ieder contact
dat in de
contactenlijst
wordt vermeld ook de bijbehorende afbeelding aangeleverd.
