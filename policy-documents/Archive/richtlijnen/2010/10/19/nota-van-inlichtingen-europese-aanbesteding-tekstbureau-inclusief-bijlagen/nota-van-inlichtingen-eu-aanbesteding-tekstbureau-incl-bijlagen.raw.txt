Voorbeeld van briefing voor advertorial, inclusief testimonials 
 
 
In de testimonials in ieder geval de volgende onderdelen beschrijven: 
• wat is de inhoud van het werk?  
• wat zijn de behaalde resultaten?  
• hoe is de belevenis van de medewerker?  
• wat zijn de ontwikkelingen in het vakgebied? 
Wat betreft het algemene deel. 
Wij denken dat het goed is om het algemene deel in tweeën te splitsen. Het eerste deel over de 
organisatie algemeen en het tweede deel gericht op de nautische functies.  
Deel 2:  
• de relevante ontwikkelingen voor de vaarweggebruikers dienen te worden belicht  
• wat gebeurt er bij RWS om dat te bereiken  
• wat zijn de successen. 
De toon van de advertorial dient niet saai te zijn, maar ook niet te popie-jopie, realistisch. 
  
 
  
 

Briefing voor direct mail of direct e-mail 
 
Een briefing kan bestaan uit een briefing voor een vacaturetekst, zoals de informatie hieronder, maar 
ook uit een al herschreven internettekst. In het eerste geval bevat de opdracht, naast het schrijven van 
een e-mailtekst, vaak ook de opdrachten voor de advertentieteksten. 
Daarbij gelden er soms specifieke wensen van EC AMC of de klant en eventueel technische 
specificaties, zoals het maximum aantal woorden.

Organisatie 
Kabinet vd Gouverneur van Sint Maarten 
In oktober 2005 is een Hoofdlijnenakkoord gesloten tussen Nederland, het land 
Nederlandse Antillen, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius en Saba. Besloten 
werd om gezamenlijk een proces van staatkundige hervorming te starten dat zou kunnen 
leiden tot het opheffen van het land de Nederlandse Antillen. In november 2006 is 
vervolgens overeengekomen dat de beoogde status van Curaçao en Sint Maarten die 
van land binnen het Koninkrijk is. Zoals thans ook het geval is in Aruba, zal de regering 
van het Koninkrijk in de nieuwe landen worden vertegenwoordigd door de Gouverneur 
van Curaçao respectievelijk de Gouverneur van Sint Maarten. Beide Gouverneurs zullen 
in ieder geval op 10 oktober 2010 in functie moeten zijn. 
Om aan zijn verplichtingen te kunnen voldoen, wordt de Gouverneur bijgestaan door het 
Kabinet van de Gouverneur. Het Kabinet van de Gouverneur van Sint Maarten wordt 
momenteel opgebouwd door een kwartiermaker, zodat het kabinet de Gouverneur bij 
aanvang van zijn werkzaamheden kan ondersteunen. 
Afdeling 
Kabinet vd Gouverneur van Sint Maarten 
Het nieuwe Kabinet van de Gouverneur van Sint Maarten heeft tot taak: 
 •        Het ondersteunen van de Gouverneur in zijn hoedanigheid van vertegenwoordiger 
van de Koning als hoofd van de regering van Sint Maarten respectievelijk in zijn 
hoedanigheid van vertegenwoordiger van de regering van het Koninkrijk; 
•        Het behandelen van consulaire aangelegenheden, alsmede het verzorgen van het 
berichtenverkeer met het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken; 
•        Het Kabinet toetst regelgeving, beleidsontwikkelingen en in bepaalde gevallen ook 
de uitvoering op landsniveau aan het hoger kader (recht- en doelmatigheid, behoorlijk 
bestuur, belangen van het Koninkrijk); 
•        Het Kabinet informeert zich ten behoeve van de Gouverneur over maatschappelijke 
en politieke ontwikkelingen in het Koninkrijk, analyseert deze en bereidt gevraagd en 
ongevraagd adviezen aan de Gouverneur voor betreffende Koninkrijks- en 
Landsaangelegenheden; 
•        Het onderhouden van contacten met andere organen van de overheid, zowel 
binnen als buiten het Koninkrijk, alsmede de ondersteuning van de Gouverneur met 
betrekking tot ontvangsten, bezoeken en overige toegang tot de Gouverneur; 
•        Het behandelen van aan de Gouverneur gerichte adressen en verzoekschriften. 
Evenals het Kabinet van de Gouverneur van Aruba en het toekomstige Kabinet van 
Curacao wordt het Kabinet van de Gouverneur van Sint Maarten als zelfstandige eenheid 
binnen de rijksdienst geplaatst. Het Kabinet behoort niet tot een departement en zal als 
zodanig worden ondergebracht in Hoofdstuk IIB van de rijksbegroting, waarover de 
Minister van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties het beheer voert. Voor de 
beheersrelatie kan het Kabinet ondersteuning genieten van dit departement. Deze 
beheersrelatie is voor het Kabinet van de Gouverneur van Aruba en het huidige Kabinet

ANNEXES 
I. GENERAL BACKGROUND 
Two open competitions, an AD6 and an AD7, in the domain of Physics are being held to appoint Research 
Administrators respectively for the European Commission, mainly for the Joint Research Centre (JRC). 
The mission of the JRC is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, 
development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies. As a service of the European Commission, the 
JRC functions as a reference centre of science and technology for the Union. Close to the policy-making 
process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of special interests, 
whether private or national. 
The purpose of these competitions is to draw up reserve lists to fill vacant posts mainly in different Institutes 
of the JRC, and more particularly, in the Institute for Transuranium Elements in Karlsruhe (ITU), Germany 
and in the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) in Geel, Belgium.

I. GENERAL BACKGROUND 
Two open competitions, an AD6 and an AD7, in the domain of Spatial Sciences are being held to appoint 
Research Administrators respectively for the European Commission, mainly for the Joint Research Centre 
(JRC). 
The mission of the JRC is to provide customer-driven scientific and technical support for the conception, 
development, implementation and monitoring of EU policies. As a service of the European Commission, the 
JRC functions as a reference centre of science and technology for the Union. Close to the policy-making 
process, it serves the common interest of the Member States, while being independent of special interests, 
whether private or national. 
The purpose of these competitions is to draw up reserve lists to fill vacant posts mainly in different Institutes 
of the JRC, and more particularly, in the Institute for the Protection and Security of the Citizen (IPSC) in 
Ispra, Italy and in the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) in Ispra, Italy.

Werk je bij het Rijk, dan werk je aan de Nederlandse samenleving. Een enorm 
speelveld waarin van alles gebeurt. Een fijne werkplek dus, want als je net aan de slag 
gaat weet je vaak nog niet precies waar je interesses liggen. De rijksoverheid is dan de 
ideale werkgever: waar anders is zoveel mogelijk en kun je zoveel kanten op?  
 
Kies maar! 
Het Rijk is de verzamelnaam voor alle 13 ministeries, tientallen diensten en diverse 
zelfstandige Hoge Colleges van Staat. Met 120.000 medewerkers is het een van de grootste 
werkgevers van Nederland. Bij het Rijk werken we dagelijks aan zaken die de hele 
maatschappij aangaan. Of het nu gaat over milieu, veiligheid, werkgelegenheid, economie of 
sport, bij de Rijksoverheid kunnen we erover meepraten. Als het maar zaken zijn die iedereen 
aangaan. Je kunt bij een van de ministeries terechtkomen, maar ook bij de Belastingdienst, 
Rijkswaterstaat, de AIVD of de Algemene Rekenkamer. Er is altijd wel een plek die aansluit 
bij jouw opleiding, interesses en ambities. Of je nu veel weet van ICT of rechten, voorlichting 
en communicatie of financiën, voor jou is er altijd een werkplek bij het Rijk! 
 
Jobhoppen of specialiseren 
En eenmaal een werkplek betekent niet voor altijd diezelfde werkplek: je krijgt voldoende 
ruimte voor ontwikkeling. Bijvoorbeeld door opleidingen en trainingen te volgen, maar ook 
door een kijkje te nemen bij andere ministeries en rijksonderdelen. Hoe jij je ontwikkelt bepaal 
je zelf. Net als hoeveel tijd je in die ontwikkeling wilt steken. Je kunt carrière maken binnen 
een organisatie en je daar specialiseren, maar je kunt ook jobhoppend een loopbaan 
opbouwen. Het is niet de vraag welke kant je op kunt gaan, maar welke kant je op wilt gaan. 
Heb je lef, wilskracht en ambitie? Dan is de overstap naar een andere functie of een ander 
ministerie zo gemaakt. 
 
In heel Nederland… 
De rijksoverheid is met 120.000 werknemers een van de grootste werkgevers van Nederland. 
Het is bovendien een werkgever die overal in het land te vinden is. Dus ook bij jou in de 
buurt.  
 
…of daarbuiten 
Stopt jouw ambitie niet bij de landsgrens? Ook dan zit je goed bij de rijksoverheid. Je vergroot 
er namelijk niet alleen figuurlijk maar ook letterlijk je wereld. Je krijgt te maken met collega’s 
van verschillende nationaliteiten en met internationale ontwikkelingen. Ook kun je het Rijk 
vertegenwoordigen in het buitenland als je wordt ‘uitgeleend’ aan internationale organisaties. 
Zo kun je meedraaien bij de Europese Unie, het IMF of de Wereldhandelsorganisatie. 
 
Diverse functies, diverse mensen  
Bij het Rijk werken we dagelijks aan zaken die de hele maatschappij aangaan. We vinden het 
dan ook belangrijk dat de samenleving, die veelzijdig en divers is, zich goed in ons 
kan herkennen. Diversiteit moet onderdeel zijn van ons dagelijks werk. Het Rijk hecht daarom 
grote waarde aan diversiteit in haar personeelsbestand, en wil het aantal vrouwen in het 
management (de zogenoemde ABD-groep) en het aandeel biculturele medewerkers 
vergroten. Het aanwezige talent op de arbeidsmarkt willen we beter benutten, via instroom, 
doorstroom en behoud. 
 
Wie we zoeken  
Waar jouw mogelijkheden liggen bij het Rijk? Dat hangt af van je opleiding. Een ding is in 
ieder geval zeker: de rijksoverheid kan niet zonder hoogopgeleide professionals. Kennis van 
zaken, een kritische blik en ambitie zijn onmisbaar voor het oplossen van de vraagstukken 
van vandaag en morgen. Ben jij net afgestudeerd academicus, promovendus of heb je al 
ervaring in een baan op universitair niveau? Dan heeft het Rijk bijna altijd wel een werkplek 
voor jou. Welke studierichting je ook hebt gevolgd. Vervolgens zoek je zelf je weg binnen de 
vele werkgevers die de rijksoverheid telt. Laat je verrassen door de veelzijdigheid van de 
grootste werkgever van Nederland! 
 
Werken of stagelopen bij het Rijk?  
Werken bij het Rijk kan ook vanuit jouw vakgebied. Zo komen je inspanningen ten goede aan 
beter onderwijs, prettiger wijken of passende zorg. Je persoonlijke interesses, ambities en 
   

 
 
Ontdek de Rijksoverheid! 
 
Werk je bij Rijksoverheid, dan werk je aan de Nederlandse samenleving. 
Een enorm speelveld waarin van alles gebeurt. Dichtbij de politiek, in het 
brandpunt van de actualiteit. Het Rijk houdt zich bezig met alle aspecten 
van Nederland. Of het nu gaat over milieu, veiligheid, economie of sport, 
bij de Rijksoverheid kunnen we erover meepraten. Naast een ministerie, 
kun je bij een uitvoeringsorganisatie of bij één van de Hoge Colleges van 
Staat aan de slag. Er is altijd een plek die aansluit bij jouw opleiding, 
interesses en ambities. Je krijgt voldoende ruimte voor ontwikkeling. Hoe 
jij je ontwikkelt bepaal je zelf. Net als hoeveel tijd je in die ontwikkeling 
steekt. Tot slot zijn de functies bij het Rijk divers. Of je nu start als 
trainee, adviseur, controller of beleidsmedewerker, voor jou is er altijd 
een werkplek bij het Rijk!
