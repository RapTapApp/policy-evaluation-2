Subject: request for urgent response to Executive Council's letter of January 4th, 2017
Excellency!
In reference to my letter to you of April 9th, 2017,1 am hereby urgently requesting your
attention for the following.
I have taken note of the decision list of a procedural meeting of the Permanent Committee for
Kingdom Relations (PCKR) of the Dutch Parliament, which took placeon April 12th, 2017.
According to said decision list, the penultimate agenda point, number 14, was an open floor
question from MP van Raak about the status of your response to the Executive Council of Sint
Eustatius' letter to you of January 4th, 2017.
Contrary to what was stated in the queryof the PCKR of January 25th, 2017, and the mentioned
decision list of April 12th, 2017, the Executive Council never referred to norrequested
independence for Sint Eustatius, and is seeking an autonomous status within the Kingdom of the
Netherlands.
The decision regarding said agenda point 14, states that you will be requested to provide the
Dutch Parliament with a response to the PCKR's letter no later than June 13th, 2017 so that said
response can be taken into consideration during the meetings with the Island Councils on June
15,h, 2017.
Iconsider it very unfortunate that the Dutch Parliament has adopted a cavalier attitude towards
a matter of such great significance, and allows the letter of January 4th, 2017 which was sent on
behalf of the citizens of Sint Eustatius who are supposed to be legally represented by that same
Parliament, to go unanswered for almost six (6) months.
